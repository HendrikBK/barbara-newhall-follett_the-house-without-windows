<p class="calibre13">foothills of Mount Varcrobis, there lived with
her father and mother, Mr. and Mrs. Eigleen, a
little girl named Eepersip. She was rather lonely.
She kept advising Mr. and Mrs. Eigleen to make
a beautiful garden, where flowers would bloom
year after year, and to which birds and butterflies
would come back again and again. Accordingly all
three set to work with a will, and in a few years
they had made the most beautiful garden that was
ever seen. Around its borders bloomed apple-trees,
pear-trees, and peach-trees, and inside
them bloomed azaleas, rhododendrons, magnolias,
lilacs, honeysuckle, and fire-blossoms. Next came
the ground flowers. There were seven kinds of
roses, and there was a whole corner devoted to
early spring flowers: crocuses, daffodils, squills,
and narcissi. Another corner was carpeted with
tender anemones, all snow-white. In the centre of
the garden there was a circular bed filled with iris
of all kinds and colours. Clematis and morning-
glory vines climbed over the wooden benches, and
near the centre was a tall arch with ramblers climbing
all over it. Another bed was thickly clustered <span><span id="calibre_link-17" data-page-number="2" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/10" data-page-index="10" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/10"></span></span>with great purple violets. The paths through
the garden had gracefully bending ferns on each
side.
</p><p class="calibre13">For the first few months Eepersip was delighted
with her flowers, and the butterflies and birds
pleased her even more. But she was not a child who 
could be contented easily, and pretty soon she began
to feel lonely again. One July day a fresh idea
came into her head. She packed some sandwiches
and some crackers in a small lunch-basket. Without
telling a soul, the next morning before dawn
she slipped out of bed, dressed, and picked up her basket;
then she stole out of the cottage and away.
She went east from her home on a shady path
through beautiful woodlands, with here and there
a grove of great massive pines. And as she walked
she sang merrily.
</p><p class="calibre13">After quite a while she stepped out of the woodlands
on to a large lawn. Close to the path there
was a pool with some tiny goldfishes swimming
about in it. Then she knew that she was nearing a
house; and instead of pacing slowly along the path
she began to run; for she was afraid that someone
would see her and send her back home. But after
a few minutes she grew tired and settled down to
a reasonable pace. And as she slowed down
came into an enormous field of rhododendrons, <span><span id="calibre_link-18" data-page-number="3" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/11" data-page-index="11" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/11"></span></span>lavender, white, and brilliant red. Oh, what a
gorgeous place that was! As Eepersip walked
along, an oriole sang from a bush: she peeped into
a humming-bird's nest with two tiny white eggs in
it; she startled a vireo from its nest in a low clump
of grass, and, peeping into it, found three baby
birds. The farther she went the more her heart
began to leap within her for joy of the life she was
finding for herself. Her loneliness decreased, and
she was as free and happy as the birds or butter-flies.
</p><p class="calibre13">Soon the red and lavender rhododendrons
dropped out, leaving only the white; then the
white ones too lessened in thickness until there
were none left- All this while she had been slowly
climbing Mount Varcrobis itself. At last she came
into a small open glade, still walking cast from the
cottage&mdash;which she win nor thinking about just
then, so happy was she at thought of the new, interesting
life she had found. This glade was near
the top of the mountain, only one high peak towering
above it. Across it ran a little brook, tinkling
through the ferns and bracken.
</p><p class="calibre13">She paused on the path suddenly, then drew
back; for a doe and her daisied fawn were grazing
close by. Eepersip took from her basket a lump of
sugar. and held it out to the beautiful creatures. <span><span id="calibre_link-19" data-page-number="4" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/12" data-page-index="12" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/12"></span></span>Very hesitatingly the doe moved forward, followed
by her fawn, and at last took the lump of
sugar from Eepersip's fingers.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip had not expected this. On the contrary,
she had thought that they would he startled
and would bound away out of sight in the woods.
She gazed silently at the doe, who had begun to
graze again without a sign of fear. Could it be a
dream? she thought. Eepersip had experienced the
delightful sensation of the doe's slightly rough
tongue around her fingers; and suddenly, she felt
as if she could never leave them&mdash;as if she must
stay always and play with the woods. Already she
had become acquainted with a doe and a fawn,
and they were not afraid of her! She sat down on
the grass, and the fawn lay beside her. She cuddled
it close in her arms.
</p><p class="calibre13">Then it grew dark. The sun was sinking, and at
last it went behind a thin, filmy cloud, producing
wonderful colours, red, gold, silver, and purple
Like fire it glowed and quivered, and through it
all could be seen the ball of the sun, growing
clearer as it sank, and growing larger too. And as
Eepersip sprang to her feet and watched it glow
and quiver, she saw, away of, an enormous range
of mountains; and where the mountains left off
them was the edge of the ocean, with the light of <span><span id="calibre_link-20" data-page-number="5" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/13" data-page-index="13" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/13"></span></span>the dying day reflected in it, in purples, reds, and
yellows.
</p><p class="calibre13">And then, being very tired, she lay down on the
grass beside the two deer; and in a few seconds
she was sound asleep.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">The next morning Eepersip was surprised to
find herself lying there on the grass between the
doe and her fawn; she had forgotten about running
away. The first thing she thought of was her
breakfast; for, not having anything to eat the
day before except a few handfuls of delicious red
berries which she had found growing on a thick
vine, she was very hungry. Not a sandwich in her
basket had she touched;she had been so fascinated
with her adventure that she had not thought of
them. But now she ate three whole ones, ever and
again breaking off bits and feeding them to the deer.
</p><p class="calibre13">When she had finished, she set off in a great
hurry to explore her surroundings. First she
walked in the direction of the beautiful sunset
she had seen, a little off the direction of the
path by which she had ascended, and came to a
great rocky precipice, the side of the mountain. <span><span id="calibre_link-21" data-page-number="6" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/14" data-page-index="14" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/14"></span></span>She looked down; and far off she saw a shining
river, winding about in the valley below, sometimes
twisting back upon itself, then straightening
out again. But it made her giddy to look too long,
and she turned and started back to where she had
slept. The doe and her fawn were grazing quietly
when Eepersip returned. She threw herself on her
back and gazed at the clear blue sky. In it swallows
with their snowy breasts were circling, and when
the sun shone full on them their white wings glimmered
like the ice on a winter's day. A great desire
came over Eepersip. She wanted to fly and swoop
through the air like the swallows. She thought to
herself that they had always been her favourite
birds. She had always marvelled at their flight, as
now they twisted in giant corkscrews and now
swerved so as to turn almost completely over.
</p><p class="calibre13">A butterfly flew over her head&mdash;a lode yellow
butterfly who danced and glimmered before her.
Her brown eyes sparkled with delight A cricket
hopped and twittered; a bird burst into song. Almost
without knowing what she did, Eepersip
leaped into the air and began to dance. with the
swallows circling above her head and the leaves
fluttering about her. Then suddenly she sat down,
breathless. She began stripping off her shoes and
stockings. Her feet were tender, and every stick <span><span id="calibre_link-22" data-page-number="7" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/15" data-page-index="15" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/15"></span></span>she stepped on hurt&nbsp;; but she was determined
to get her feet toughened
so as to go barefoot all the
time.
</p><p class="calibre13">Now, directly east of this fairy glade there was
steep slope which ascended to the very summit of
Mount Varcrobis, called Eiki-ennern Peak. Eepersip
had a fascinated eye for this slope and longed
to see what was at the top of it, but she would not
leave the deer just yet, and also she was determined
not to put on her shoes and stockings again.
So she decided to stay in the soft grass until her
feet were toughened; and she thought that then
she could go up that wonderful peak over which
the sun rose in clouds of glory every morning.
</p><p class="calibre13">Before Eepersip had danced long she walked
down toward the great precipice again, with her
shoes and stockings under her arms. The instant
the got there a madness came upon her, and
<i class="calibre10">whizz!</i> two shoes and two stockings were flying
through the air at a tremendous rate. They landed
in the trees far below, while Eepersip, glad to get
rid of them, coolly returned to the glade, thinking
that her feet were already tougher than before
because of that bold act. When she got back she
decided to rest a while, then walk in the opposite
direction and see what was at the northern end of
the glade. So when she got rested she started off <span><span id="calibre_link-23" data-page-number="8" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/16" data-page-index="16" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/16"></span></span>that way, with the doe and the fawn trotting beside
her. At last she came to the slope of the mountain
on that side. But this, instead of being a sheer
precipice, was a gradually falling grassy bank,
down which they went. The doe and the fawn followed
some distance; then they turned back, letting
Eepersip go on alone. But when she got part
way to the bottom she began to see houses; ans so,
deciding that that wasn't the side for her, she ran
back as fast as she could.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span> 
</p><p class="calibre13">Meanwhile Mr. and Mrs. Eigleen were wandering
in vain where their poor child had gone. At
first they hadn't thought much about her, for she
had been lost in the woods several times before
and had always found her way home safely. But
when it came to being gone two or three whole
days, why, they were not sure they they were
awake! The child must be starving, and who knew
what a tender morsel to some prowling animal she
might be by this time? So they began to grieve
greatly over their loss, for they dearly loved 
Eepersip. 
</p><p class="calibre13">Before they has missed her very long, a poor
old woman and her husband had climbed that part <span><span id="calibre_link-24" data-page-number="9" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/17" data-page-index="17" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/17"></span></span>of Mount Varcrobis. Nobody in the village down
below cared much for Mr. and Mrs. Ikkisfield, as
they were called; and they had decided to go elsewhere
and see if they could find some friends. The
Eigleens took pity on them, and at last persuaded
them to live in the brown cottage in the woods, and
to let the Eigleens themselves go to the house of
friends of theirs, the Wraspanes. It was the Wraspanes' rhododendron field that Eepersip had
thought so beautiful.
</p><p class="calibre13">The Eigleens, being exceedingly kind people,
gladly gave up their cottage and thaw beautiful
garden to Mr. and Mrs. Ikkisfield. Indeed, these
things were no joy to them, now that they had lost
Eepersip, for whose sake they had made the garden.
The old couple were delighted, and, thanking
the Eigleens very kindly, they moved in that same
evening, the Eigleens leaving some of their
belongings with them.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip stayed for many days with the doe and
her fawn, and then, bet feet having become tough,
she crossed the brooklet and went on up Eiki-ennern
Peak. Near the top, in a small sheltered place,
she found a dear little pool surrounded with moss
and ferns, amongst which some iris bloomed. It had
a sandy bottom, over which swam tiny silver minnows.
When they turned over and the sun shone on <span><span id="calibre_link-25" data-page-number="10" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/18" data-page-index="18" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/18"></span></span>their bellies Eepersip saw a streak of silver. At
last, when she got to the top, she saw that on one
side it was a vast daisied slope, down,down; and
on another it was wooded to the foot. From where
she stood, range after range spread out before
her, lake after lake beneath her, with the crimson
of the now setting sun gloriously reflected in them.
It was like fairyland. And when Eepersip turned
southward, she beheld the almighty ocean with
the exquisite sunset colours reflected in it as in the
lakes. That night she slept on a soft bed of moss
in a hollow down near the pool.
</p><p class="calibre13">The next morning, after she had made a good
breakfast on the juicy root of a plant which she
found, she lay down by the pool and gazed at the
sky, the way she had done on the second day of her
wildness. And as she lay there it grew so quiet that
a chipmunk stole out of a tiny hole that he had dug
between the roots of a tree. He came to her,
sniffed at a cracker she was munching, and tickled
her cheek with his nose; whereupon she cautiously
put out her hand with a piece of the cracker on it
The chipmunk was frightened and ran away. But
the piece of cracker looked very tempting, and before
long he lost his fear and ventured close again.
Step by step he crept along, until, with a frightened
squeal, he seized the piece and disappeared. Eepersip <span><span id="calibre_link-26" data-page-number="11" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/19" data-page-index="19" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/19"></span></span>waited, laughing. In a few minutes he came
back again, and this time he took the piece that she
held out to him, running only a few steps. The
third time he took it calmly and deliberately and
ate it without running at all, evidently convinced
that Eepersip was a friend. And the fourth time he
was even more bold, going so far as to sit on her
stomach while he ate. But by that time, between
them, they had licked the platter clean--the
cracker was gone.
</p><p class="calibre13">“Just like the doe and her fawn,” Eepersip
thought. How fearless he was, the fuzzy brown
little creature! It seemed to happy Eepersip that
all the wild was ready to make friends, as if nothing
were afraid of her. She felt more than ever
that she could never leave these entrancing forests.
She could never, never go back, she mused. How
wonderful it was to lie there watching the things
that were happening, and actually to have one of
the inhabitants of these woods--a timid one that
was usually afraid--come up to her and eat from
her hand! This adventure had certainly tightened
in her heart the desire to stay always and become
acquainted with more and more creatures--with
the swallows she loved so well, and with the little
fairy butterflies.
</p><p class="calibre13">Whenever she went down to the sheltered spot <span><span id="calibre_link-27" data-page-number="12" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/20" data-page-index="20" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/20"></span></span>by the pool, she saw so many beautiful things here
and there that she never knew what to do in her
delight. Iris blossomed in gold and blue; butterflies
danced overhead like yellow rose-petals flying
in the breeze. Once, running over to the pool, she
found a tiny beach, about fifteen inches long and
half a foot wide&mdash;no more than a handful of
sand completely hidden in a forest of ferns. Across
it ran the chipmunk's footprints, and the marks of
his wee claws could be plainly seen in the damp
sand. That little beach was the earth's dear treasure,
so it seemed to Eepersip, alone in that wild
place. In the fields all around, thousands of buttercups
blossomed, and great beds of daisies whitened
the earth's brown surface.
</p><p class="calibre13">In one place, among dark ferns, grew columbine,
gay little gypsies curtseying in the breeze.
Their colours spoke to her of dawn, gold sunset
and white clouds, snow-banks fringed with icicles,
night sky entwined with moonbeams, black clouds
and radiant sun, or orange, yellow, and scarlet
leaves--autumn leaves. She gathered some, and
made a rainbow wreath of blossoms; and curling
about her hair, they danced again.
</p><p class="calibre13">Beneath the branches of a white pine grew
blushing lady-slippers, which Eepersip had never
seen before. "Dawn comes to earth sometimes" <span><span id="calibre_link-28" data-page-number="13" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/21" data-page-index="21" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/21"></span></span>she thought, “bringing her flower-clouds and
clasping them with pearl seeds.”
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip was anxious to know what was on the
southern slope of this highest peak of Mt. Varcrobis.
So one day along she went, happily singing,
until she came to it. Then she was surprised to find
that this slope, instead of being a rocky precipice
as the one had been at the foot of Eiki-ennern
Peak, went down steeply for a little way and then
broadened out into an enormous field, on the farther
side of which was a herd of deer. Away, away,
Eepersip could just see to the edge of this plain-like
field. With a shout, down she dashed; and,
dancing as she had never danced before, she sang
like a nightingale for joy of her discovery. And
yet, she thought to herself, what if it should be a
dream? She was quite sure that it was not, though,
for she had felt decidedly awake when she started
off. But, because she had started before anyone else
was up or even awake, she thought that she might
be asleep herself. Anyhow, if it was a dream, it was
a lovely one, and she need not worry
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">But now let us return to the grieving parents of
Eepersip, who were consulting the Wraspanes
about a plan to search for her. <span><span id="calibre_link-29" data-page-number="14" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/22" data-page-index="22" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/22"></span></span>At last Mrs: Eigleen said: "Something very
queer has happened to our child. She must have
seen something of other that has made her want
to go off. But I will tell you what we can do. We'll
take the Wraspanes’ big tent, and, fetching the
Ikkisfields, we can camp near where one of us sees
Eepersip; for I’m sure that she wouldn’t leave
Mount Varcrobis unless absolutely compelled to.
We can learn what habits Eepersip has got into,
and perhaps we can catch her by some plan. My
husband and you, Mr. Wraspane, are the spry
ones, and perhaps you can hide behind trees and
catch her when she goes past."
</p><p class="calibre13">"What a grand idea!" cried everybody else in
one voice; and without further ado they decided to
carry it out.
</p><p class="calibre13">So the very next day Mr. Eigleen and Mr.
Wraspane set off to explore, on the chance of finding
Eepersip or discovering where she was living.
They reasoned out that Eepersip must have gone
through the Wraspanes’ land when running off;
because on the western side of the Eigleens’ little
cottage there was a dense wood, of which Eepersip
had always been rather afraid, it was so dark and
mysterious. They went through the field of rhododendrons,
on the selfsame path, and at last came
out in the same small glade in which Eepersip had <span><span id="calibre_link-30" data-page-number="15" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/23" data-page-index="23" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/23"></span></span>seen the deer, with the same brooklet running
across it. They hunted all over it, but no trace of
Eepersip could they find. They began to feel foolish.
They decided to go back and tell the waiting
folks that they had not seen a glimpse of her, when
a glorious burst of singing reached their ears. Immediately
they turned and ran in the direction of 
the voice. But still they didn’t see her, for they
never dreamed that she had gone up the steep
slope of Eiki-ennern Peak. And they began to feel
still more foolish.
</p><p class="calibre13">At last, after a lot of aimless wandering through
forests, glades, and fields, they decided to give it
up for just then and tell the folks that they had
heard her, but couldn’t find her. So back they went,
feeling very foolish indeed.
</p><p class="calibre13">"We were looking for her everywhere," said
Mr. Eigleen, "and after we had searched for a
long time we heard this excellent singing, better
than I thought she could utter, and we went in its
direction, but couldn't find her. So I am beginning
to think that 'twasn't she at all--either she or a
fairy."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Fairy!" exclaimed Mrs. Eigleen, indignantly
&mdash;"fairy! There is no such thing as 'fairy'&mdash;
stupid!"
</p><p class="calibre13">Mr. Eigleen cast a wink at his partner hunter, <span><span id="calibre_link-31" data-page-number="16" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/24" data-page-index="24" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/24"></span></span>Mr. Wraspane. "Anyhow," said he, "fairy or
none, we heard the singing."
</p><p class="calibre13">Again Mrs. Eigleen burst out with: "But why
didn't you go right <i class="calibre10">to</i> the sound?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Dear wife," said Mr. Eigleen, "we couldn't,
because directly in front of that sound there was a
very steep rocky slope&mdash;you know very well the
slope of Eiki-ennern Peak."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Well," said Mrs. Eigleen, "if the voice came
from behind behind that slope, Eepersip must have got to
the top of Eiki-ennern Peak somehow, and if <i class="calibre10">she</i>
did, <i class="calibre10">you</i> can. Wait with us a while and have lunch,
and then go and try to find her again, and I will
come with you."
</p><p class="calibre13">"All right," said Mr. Eigleen.
</p><p class="calibre13">Accordingly, after lunch all three started off on
a fresh quest. They searched the little glade high
and low once more, but with the same ill luck.
Really Eepersip saw them all the time, but while
they were here she was there, and while they were
there she was here, all the time keeping out of
sight behind bushes and trees: And when she
rustled the leaves and they heard her, they thought
that it was just the breezes making commotion in
the leaves and grass.
</p><p class="calibre13">Before they had hunted very long Mrs. Eigleen
had to admit that the new game was harder than <span><span id="calibre_link-32" data-page-number="17" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/25" data-page-index="25" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/25"></span></span>it looked; yet she didn’t give it up, for her greatest
hope was to have Eepersip back again. At length
Eepersip lost sight of them and, thinking that they
had gone, she began to sing. They all started, and
began to run in the direction of the voice. This
time they didn't hesitate to go right up the steep
slope of Eiki-ennern Peak. Mrs. Eigleen leading,
they all three dashed up, with not a thought of the
brambles that they were getting into.
</p><p class="calibre13">When they got to the top, what a sight met their
puzzled eyes! There was Eepersip dancing to her
own singing, and ever and again she looked up at
a little butterfly which fluttered over her head, and
curtseyed before it. Great waves of happiness were
flowing through her all the time. They made no
effort to call her, but only stood enchanted until
she danced off to the field. Then they quickly
walked away. First they went back to their own
little cottage and collected some of the important 
belongings which they had left there. Next they
went on to the Wraspanes’ house and got the tent
and other necessary things. Then, with the Ikkisfields
and the Wraspanes, they started off for the
top of Eiki-ennern Peak.
</p><p class="calibre13">They pitched the tent rather far from the pool,
but very near where they had seen Eepersip, on top
of the hill. Now the next problem was to make the <span><span id="calibre_link-33" data-page-number="18" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/26" data-page-index="26" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/26"></span></span>plans; and as soon as the tent was up they gathered
together and began to think up ways and means.
But Mr. Eigleen said: "Let us go on an exploration
and discover some of Eepersip's habits. Let
us all wander around a while, and when we discover
what sort of habits Eepersip has got into,
we can make our plans accordingly; for we can't
make plans until we <i class="calibre10">do</i> know some of her habits." 
</p><p class="calibre13">All approved of what he had said, and everybody
prepared himself for a long walk, interrupted
at times by hiding and lurking, peeping and
sneaking. So each person had a bite to eat and set
off to explore the surroundings. They hunted high
and low, but never saw a sign of Eepersip--never
had a chance to peep and sneak. That evening
however, while they were talking things over, they
heard another burst of singing. They leaped to
their feet and, taking a big lantern, all started out
of the tent. In the direction of the singing they
went on, trying to walk rather fast, but also trying
not to step on many leaves or dry twigs so as to
make a noise; and when they talked it was in the
softest whisper. The singing sounded nearer and
nearer; but they could not see very well without
the lantern (which they didn't light yet for fear of
frightening Eepersip away); it was darkening
rapidly, and things were very dim. At last the singing <span><span id="calibre_link-34" data-page-number="19" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/27" data-page-index="27" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/27"></span></span>grew so loud and so near that they felt almost
as if they were about to run into it. And so they
actually did; for Eepersip, who had all the time
been approaching them as they approached her,
went right between the Ikkisfields, startling them
so that they didn’t know what to do! Mr. Ikkisfield
managed to put out his hand and grab her dress,
calling for someone to come and help him hold
her. But by this time Eepersip had discarded her
real dress and had woven one of ferns for herself;
and, the ferns being interlaced rather loosely, the
one Mr. Ikkisfield caught hold of tore away.
Quick as a flash Eepersip bounded away into the
night. Thus their first chance of catching her
slipped between their fingers. They went back to
the tent rather discouraged.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">Now the deer in the great field knew Eepersip,
and they all loved her, because she was so kind to
them. Even the little fawns loved her and made no
attempt to run away when she appeared. Twilight
and dawn, when the deer were all lying down, were
her favourite times in the field. Then she would
dance about in her fern dress, singing so sweetly
that all the birds watched her. She began to love <span><span id="calibre_link-35" data-page-number="20" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/28" data-page-index="28" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/28"></span></span>the birds and butterflies even more than in the first
days of her wildness, and almost worshipped them.
</p><p class="calibre13">The morning after this curious face-to-face
meeting with Eepersip, Mr. Eigleen spoke about
another plan. "Eepersip every morning comes up
from wherever she sleeps to get a drink of water
from the little pool. Now do you know that big
pine-tree that stands beside the pool?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes," said Mrs. Eigleen.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Well, I will go and hide behind that tree tomorrow
morning, and when she comes up to the
pool I will try to catch her by jumping out at her
when she comes by."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Why do you not do it this morning?" inquired
Mrs. Ikkisfield.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Well, you see," replied Mr. Eigleen, "she
has had her morning drink, for I saw her as was
getting out of bed."
</p><p class="calibre13">"I see," said Mrs. Ikkisfield. "But be sure that
you get up in time next morning."
</p><p class="calibre13">"I will," said Mr. Eigleen. "But if you're up
and awake before I am, be sure to pull me by my
left ear."
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip was becoming more wary, now she had
discovered that they were trying to catch her. But
still she took it as a sort of joke. In the first place,
she thought she could easily escape again if they <span><span id="calibre_link-36" data-page-number="21" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/29" data-page-index="29" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/29"></span></span>did catch her. But she very much doubted if they
could do it. For hours every day she practised
running, leaping, dancing, and prowling, until she
was as fleet as a deer and as soft on her feet as a
lynx. She had practised leaping over high objects,
and if someone were chasing her she could now
escape being cornered by jumping a fence. She had
trained herself until, even without a running start,
she could clear the back of a standing fawn, or,
with a start, a large buck standing full height. All
these exercises made her light as a feather and
graceful as a fern.
</p><p class="calibre13">The next morning when Mr. Eigleen woke up,
there was hardly a ray of light, but dawn was
breaking out here and there. Mr. Eigleen got all
ready for an exciting morning. Without waking
anybody, he seated himself out in front of the tent,
on the side next the field, in such a position that he
could see Eepersip when she came up, and where
he could pull-to the front flap immediately and
bolt out the back way to the tree by the pool without
her seeing him. He waited a few minutes, and
then he saw her head bobbing up the bank. Hurriedly
he closed the front flap before she saw him.
Slipping out the other end and round in a long
curve, he ran at full speed to the pool and hid
behind the big pine. <span><span id="calibre_link-37" data-page-number="22" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/30" data-page-index="30" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/30"></span></span>
Now it was at the foot of the pine that Eepersip
usually stooped over to drink, because there
the water was deeper and clearer. When Eepersip
came up the bank, she stared curiously at the ten,
thinking: "What! are my parents still here?"
Then on she went to the pool. She approached it
in a roundabout direction, her face drawn with
suspicion; but, as usual, her route ended at the
gnarled roots of the big pine--no instinct could
draw her away from it.
</p><p class="calibre13">Mr. Eigleen stirred the leaves gently as she
bent over. She lay down flat by the tree, cupped
her hands, and began to drink. Very quietly Mr.
Eigleen put his hands on her, one on either shoulder,
knowing that her dress of ferns would tear.
She started, and struggled so violently that his
hands relaxed their grip on her shoulders, sliding
down her arms, so that they were now hand in
hand. That was all Eepersip needed. With a tremendous
sweep she took her feet off the ground,
dragging down on his arms with all her weight and
strength. Mr. Eigleen couldn't relax either of his
hands, for she now held them fast. With another
sweep she put her feet up on his shoulders and 
over his head; then, wrenching her own hands
free, she slid down his back and slipped before
he could seize her. <span><span id="calibre_link-38" data-page-number="23" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/31" data-page-index="31" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/31"></span></span>When Mr. Eigleen went home everyone was
surprised at this acrobatic adventure.
</p><p class="calibre13">Mrs. Eigleen made a plan now. "Sometime at
midnight," she said, "we could take a covered
lantern and go down on the meadow to try to find
out where Eepersip sleeps. I know the meadow is
very large, but common sense tells me that she
would sleep near the woods; so to-morrow night
let's go and try to find her."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Er--er--I don't know," replied Mr. Eigleen.
"I’m a little bit afraid of that meadow, such
curious things are happening there all the time."
</p><p class="calibre13">"What has happened yet?" snapped Mrs.
Eigleen. "You're an old coward, you are. I'd go
in a minute, to save Eepersip."
</p><p class="calibre13">"So’d I, so’d I," said Mr. Eigleen, hurriedly.
"T only think that there is some curious magic
about that field."
</p><p class="calibre13">"I agree with you there," said Mrs. Eigleen.
"But, as I said before, when it comes to saving
Eepersip I'd go into thicker magic than there is in
the field."
</p><p class="calibre13">So they planned to get up a little after midnight
and circle the field near the edge of the woods;
and as there were six of them, Eepersip wouldn't
have much chance of escaping if they once got
their hands on her. That evening they ate a light <span><span id="calibre_link-39" data-page-number="24" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/32" data-page-index="32" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/32"></span></span>supper and went to bed early, and about one
o'clock they got up and went out into the great
field with a hooded lantern. They circled around
it; and at last they found Eepersip hidden in the
bushes on the farther edge. Very gently all six
laid hands upon her at once.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Ah, we've captured her!" they cried triumphantly.
"Our labours have been rewarded!"
</p><p class="calibre13">But Eepersip, finding herself caught, became
angry, and cried in a loud, commanding voice:
"Put me down! Drop me immediately!" She
added quietly to herself: "Now it’s all over."
</p><p class="calibre13">Then she began to struggle very violently indeed.
They had hold of her securely, and so her
struggles were in vain. But just as they carried her
past a sleeping doe which had no fawn, she uttered
a shrill, wild cry; and this so startled the six that
they almost dropped her. The doe woke up; and
though she was afraid for herself, she was more
afraid for Eepersip. She came galloping after
them.
</p><p class="calibre13">To see the doe galloping swiftly toward them
naturally startled old Mrs. Ikkisfield, who supposed
that all wild animals would flee at the sight
of a human being. That was so generally--but
not when Eepersip was in danger! Now, Mrs.
Ikkisfield had hold of the most important part of <span><span id="calibre_link-40" data-page-number="25" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/33" data-page-index="33" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/33"></span></span>Eepersip’s anatomy, though no one suspected it
at the time--namely, her feet. Mrs. Ikkisfield
dropped them, and for the fraction of an instant
which Eepersip needed they were allowed to touch
the ground. Eepersip wrenched herself free and
leaped to the back of the trembling, excited creature,
and they bounded away quick as a flash. The
others, agitated, turned to chase the doe; but she,
with Eepersip on her back, had vanished.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Whew, that was a narrow escape!" Eepersip
whispered in one of the doe’s long ears, as they
lay down together.
</p><p class="calibre13">The next day it rained hard. Eepersip's parents
and their friends spent much time making plans
for a day when they could go out. Mrs. Ikkisfield
now made a suggestion
</p><p class="calibre13">"It is," she said, "very like the plan that we
tried last night--namely, to find Eepersip while
she is sleeping. But we must have more people,
more people! If we can get some friends from the
village at the foot of the mountain, they can drive
the deer that we meet away from the people that
are carrying Eepersip. In that way she cannot be
saved by deer."
</p><p class="calibre13">"That is true,” said Mrs. Eigleen; "but, you
know, often an angry herd of deer is a terrible
thing to drive back." <span><span id="calibre_link-41" data-page-number="26" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/34" data-page-index="34" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/34"></span></span>"I know that," said Mrs. Ikkisfield. "But we
might be able to keep them cool--keep them
from getting angry. However, let's make some
other plans now. That is not a very good one."
</p><p class="calibre13">"I was thinking," said Mrs. Wraspane, "if we
could only get Eepersip into a small fenced-in area
where we could catch her. But I have it: let us find
Eepersip in her sleep again, and carry her to the
tent in a roundabout route through the woods,
chopping the bushes as we go, where there aren't
so many deer, and where it will be harder for them
to rescue her."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Great idea!" cried Mrs. Ikkisfield.
</p><p class="calibre13">So that is when they all planned to do, the next
sunny day. 
</p>
<ul class="calibre28"><li class="calibre29"><ul class="calibre30"><li class="calibre29"><ul class="calibre31"><li class="calibre29"></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
<p class="calibre13">While they had been conversing in this manner,
Eepersip had been sitting in the woods, with a
little fawn and its mother for company; and she
had been feeding the fawn handfuls of grass and
gazing into its gentle eyes. Late in the evening it
cleared off and them were promises of a beautiful
day to-morrow. And so it was. The sun began to
rise slowly, producing wonderful colours--first
the most delicate shades of apple-blossom pink; <span><span id="calibre_link-42" data-page-number="27" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/35" data-page-index="35" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/35"></span></span>darker on the horizon, and shading off into a pale
buttercup yellow. And Eepersip, as she awoke, saw
that the meadow was dotted with dark forms
which could just be distinguished &mdash; the deer were
all lying down.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip skipped up to the pool to get her morning
drink, first spying all around and especially
behind every tree. No one was to be seen, for no
one was up yet. Eepersip drank her fill; then she
breakfasted on the sweet root of the little three-leaved
plant with a white blossom, her usual food.
After that she went down to the meadow, beginning
to dance and sing as soon as she got there.
The deer were now beginning to rise, and as she
danced she kissed each one.
</p><p class="calibre13">When the sun had dried the raindrops and the
dew, the families started out to the great field to
see what they could discover. The first thing they
saw when they got to the edge of the slope was
Eepersip skipping around. Then they saw her
dance off to the woods and gather some long green
branches and blossoms. Very soon she came back
to the field, went over to a sleeping doe, and
crowned her with the branches; upon which the
doe got up and licked Eepersip’s cheek. She danced
about in her delight. She was so beautiful, so
graceful, that when her parents saw her they were <span><span id="calibre_link-43" data-page-number="28" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/36" data-page-index="36" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/36"></span></span>amazed at the way in which her dancing and leaping
had improved.
</p><p class="calibre13">Now, during the days in which Eepersip had
been growing wild she had made friends with
another chipmunk, who was even more fond of her
than the one by the pool had been. The Eigleens
and their friends now saw him scutter out of the
woods end frolic around Eepersip. Last of all they
saw Eepersip lie down on the grass to gaze at the
sky. 
</p><p class="calibre13">"This would be a splendid opportunity for
catching her," muttered Mr. Ikkisfield to Mr.
Eigleen, as they looked at her.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Hm! that’s just what I was thinking," whispered
Mr. Eigleen in reply. "Suppose we go out
in the field and try."
</p><p class="calibre13">They all tiptoed down the slope and out into
the field, where they immediately laid hands on
Eepersip once more. She started violently and
cried oat to the doe who was near. The doe dashed
up, but did not succeed in rescuing Eepersip, for
Mrs. Ikkisfield ran to hold her back.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Never mind Eepersip--Mr. Eigleen and
Mr. Wraspane can do that. Hold back the deer!"
thundered Mrs. Eigleen, a slow red rising to her
face. They all flew at the poor creature, except the
two who were holding the struggling Eepersip. <span><span id="calibre_link-44" data-page-number="29" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/37" data-page-index="37" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/37"></span></span>Off fled the doe; and then the others could help
with Eepersip. The doe ran on to get help from
her mate. Back they came in no time, for a deer is
one of the swiftest runners in the world. The buck
flew at Eepersip’s captors--just too late, for the
others had succeeded in getting Eepersip safely
into the tent.
</p><p class="calibre13">But what could they do with her? How could
they keep her securely? And, even so, if she was
going to continue acting wildly, how much better
off were they with her? This was a new question,
which no one had thought of. But they decided
that, if they could keep her safely, she would become
tamed and civilized again. The question of
security was the most important just then. Better
go home immediately and take Eepersip with
them, later returning for their tent and their belongings.
This they did, locking Eepersip in the
house while they were getting their things; and as
they went they rejoiced.
</p><p class="calibre13">But now all the deer of the field, knowing that
Eepersip, their beloved queen, had been taken
from them, put their heads together. They intended
to rescue her while her father and mother
were sleeping, if they could only find where she
had been taken. While they were lying down and
thinking about it, a fawn came running up and <span><span id="calibre_link-45" data-page-number="30" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/38" data-page-index="38" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/38"></span></span>poked its mother. It had followed softly, and knew
just where Eepersip was kept. They all lay down
to wait for the coming of night. At last evening
came, and the deer fell asleep, leaving a night-watchman
to arouse them later when the full moon
was at its zenith. When the watchman signalled
they arose and, with the little fawn leading, went
down toward the Wraspanes' house. Eepersip was
allowed to sleep out on the porch, but all its glass
doors were closed and locked against her. The
fawn led them straight to this place.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip could not go to sleep; she sat on the
floor, whining softly in her misery. One of the
bucks knocked gently on the glass door with his
antler. Eepersip turned; a smile crept over her
face at the sight of her beloved comrades. The
buck, as softly as he could, broke one of the glass
doors, wood and all. Then the deer, all except the
fawn, bounded off to the field again.
</p><p class="calibre13">The sound of breaking glass reached the ears of
Mr. Ikkisfield, who was awake, all too late; for
by the time he had wakened the others--which he
did by shouting "Get up! get up! Sounds like high
doings out there!"--Eepersip, on the little
fawn's back, had vanished toward the field. The
families, when they got to the porch, found only
the broken door. Though they heard trampling <span><span id="calibre_link-46" data-page-number="31" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/39" data-page-index="39" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/39"></span></span>hoofs, they knew that it would be of no use to
follow.
</p><p class="calibre13">The families, after that adventure, were desperate;
and they decided not to make any more
plans just then, for winter was coming on rapidly,
but to stay at the house until the next summer.

<p class="calibre13">As for Eepersip, well, she was mighty glad to
have got away unhurt. Happy again, she was soon
sound asleep in the woods on the edge of the field,
cuddled up underneath the doe which had saved
her before. She wasn’t sure how to get along
through the winter safely, but she had had such a
splendid summer that she knew it would be foolish
to give up her wild life now. She could manage
somehow.
</p><p class="calibre13">And so she did. She found that her parents had
left her own heavy winter coat in the place where
they had once found her sleeping; and this would
be very helpful to her, she thought. She was also
glad to realize that her parents, much though they
wanted to get her back, didn't wish her to perish
in the cold of winter. "They <i class="calibre10">are</i> nice people, after
all!" she thought to herself.
</p><p class="calibre13">With the coat and the prospect of warmth, <span><span id="calibre_link-47" data-page-number="32" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/40" data-page-index="40" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/40"></span></span>there came a delightful idea into her head. On the
edge of the meadow there was an old dilapidated
fox-hole. It was very large already; and after
about ten days of hard work Eepersip found that
the passages could be made exactly large enough
for her to crawl into. The earth was so loose and
mouldy that it came away without difficulty. She
crept down the tunnel a long way, digging as she
went. Presently she came to a snug bedroom about
five feet square and four and a half high, which
was a little less than her own height. But she did
not mind stooping, as long as she had this cunning
room; besides, she could dig away the ceiling if
she wanted to. The room was old and dirty, but
Eepersip lined it entirely with grass. Digging
around, in one corner she came upon a little packet
made of leaves. Inside it were a few cordary-berries
seeds<sup id="calibre_link-7" class="reference"><a href="#calibre_link-6" type="noteref">[1]</a></sup>! She wondered who had made this packet--who
had lived in this burrow before her. A
person, of that she was sure. These seeds had not
by any means rotted; they were still as moist and
sweet as ever, and Eepersip rejoiced to them.
Digging around some more, she discovered a small
</p><p class="calibre13">The cordary berry grows during the winter and is at its best
at New Year. The seeds have sweet meats. The berries are bright
red, and the seeds dark purple, running over inside with sweet
juice which keeps the kernel moist. <span><span id="calibre_link-48" data-page-number="33" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/41" data-page-index="41" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/41"></span></span>square block of wood. Lifting it up, she found
great heaps of milkweed pods, kept from springing
open by the pressure of the earth against
them. She rejoiced in this too. There was enough
of the milkweed to make a bed for herself. She
covered the bed with her old dress, which she had
kept all this time in case she should need it. Never
was such a soft bed seen. In the burrow she also
built several shelves of boards, and on these she
heaped up more cordary berries and their seeds,
which were just beginning to come.
</p><p class="calibre13">The next day was the last of November. In the
morning Eepersip, after a long sleep in the burrow,
woke up to find the world white with the first
snow. The entrance of the tunnel was placed at
Such an angle that never a flake found its way
down in Eepersip was delighted; she danced and
skipped about, with the chipmunk at her heels.
</p><p class="calibre13">The next day it stopped snowing, and the sun
came out, shining dimly. Every snow-crystal sparkled
like a diamond. Eepersip and the chipmunk
dashed across the meadow and looked far, far
down. Though ordinary eyes could not have seen
to the end of this mass of glittering whiteness,
Eepersip's could, and beyond all the icicles and
snowflakes she saw the river calmly shining, blue
as the sky. In its rippling surface Eepersip could <span><span id="calibre_link-49" data-page-number="34" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/42" data-page-index="42" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/42"></span></span>see the very reflection of the sun breaking out
through a cloud. The meadow was beautiful even
when the sun was dim, but nothing to what it was
now!
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip could see every colour of the rainbow
reflected in each crystal--orange, purple, green,
blue, red, and many, many iridescent tints. Full of
joy, she looked down upon the river once more,
through the glittering iridescence. The longer she
looked, the better she could see the river. But at
last the sun went in again; it had been out hardly
long enough to melt one snowflake. Everywhere
round Eepersip went the chipmunk's little footprints,
for he had shared her delight. At last, when
Eepersip wanted to go back to her subterranean
shelter, the chipmunk hung back and whimpered.
Eepersip saw that he wanted to stay; and knowing
that he could find his way, she left him behind and
went back to the burrow herself.
</p><p class="calibre13">But he didn’t come back. She waited and waited
and often called, but he did not appear. "What
can have have happened to my little friend?" she
thought. At last she set out to look for him, calling
as she went. She looked in every crevice, to see
whether something had frightened him and he had
plunged into some hiding-place. But she did not
find him. At last, whistling and calling, she came <span><span id="calibre_link-50" data-page-number="35" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/43" data-page-index="43" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/43"></span></span>near to where she had left him, on the edge of the
meadow. Then what did she see in the snow but
footprints--human footprints! Chippy's little
tracks had started back in the direction of the burrow,
but the strange footprints came towards his
and overtook them--and at that point his suddenly
left off. Then she discovered the others
going down the hill again. It was only too clear--Chippy
had been captured!
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip sat down in the snow and wept. But
suddenly she straightened up and became herself
again. Why not follow those footprints down the
hill and get her Chippy back? With a hopeful
heart she dashed down, following the tracks. But
she came into a small village, where she was afraid
of being caught. She could not go on; so she went
back.
</p><p class="calibre13">Another idea! Why not follow the footprints
some night, when there were not so many people
around, and when, even if there were, she would
not be seen so easily? But there the question
of being able to see the footprints in the dark. No,
that would be impossible: the only thing to do
would be to wait. For what, Eepersip had not the
slightest idea.
</p><p class="calibre13">The name of the people who had captures the
chipmunk was Brunio. Mr. Brunio and his little <span><span id="calibre_link-51" data-page-number="36" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/44" data-page-index="44" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/44"></span></span>twin daughters, Flitterveen and Caireen, had come
up to the meadow with sleds and skis to slide.
They had seen the chipmunk frolicking about, and
had watched him impatiently.
</p><p class="calibre13">"How I would like that little animal for my
own!" said Flitterveen.
</p><p class="calibre13">"He looks cold and hungry, Father," said
Caireen. "Here, I have some crackers in my
pocket. Let us throw them to him and see if he will
eat them."
</p><p class="calibre13">This they had done, and the chipmunk had been
tempted. He had come up cautiously and nibbled
at them. He loved Eepersip dearly. He had never
received harm from one of those queer two-legged
creatures. He trusted them. But, while he had been
nibbling, Mr. Brunio had sneaked up quietly and
taken him. Thus he had been captured.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip was not able to free her little friend
until the next spring. She had lived a rather lonely
life without him through the winter, ans one morning
very early she decided to make a desperate attempt
to rescue him. She went down the slope of
the hill to the river, through grass wet with pearly
dew-drops. She stole along the bank of the river. <span><span id="calibre_link-52" data-page-number="37" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/45" data-page-index="45" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/45"></span></span>behind bushes as much as possible, so as not to be
seen. Finally she came to a little wooden bridge,
and across this she went. But from there she had
no idea how to proceed. She looked all about her,
bewildered, afraid among so many houses.
</p><p class="calibre13">It was a heavenly morning. The sun rose and
cast a sweet golden light over the earth. The grass
sparkled as if with diamonds. A fresh spring
breeze was blowing gently. Flowers grew here in
the deep grass, and myriads of butterflies came
flocking. But Eepersip stood forlorn and discouraged.
</p><p class="calibre13">Suddenly a faint squeaking came to her. She
darted toward the sound. O Eepersip, beware--not
too fast! The squeaking came from one side of
a dark brown house. Eepersip saw a small wire
cage, and in it her little brown Chippy. Mr. Brunio
had opened the squeaky door of the house and was
coming out with Chippy's food. Eepersip saw him,
and swerved aside into the shelter of a gigantic
rose-bush before he saw her--just in the nick of
time. It seemed like a long wait, but after a while
Mr. Brunio went into the house again.
</p><p class="calibre13">Looking cautiously about her, Eepersip tiptoed
out, opened the door of the cage, seized Chippy,
id sped off. Thus he was rescued; and Eepersip
was happy indeed! <span><span id="calibre_link-53" data-page-number="38" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/46" data-page-index="46" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/46"></span></span>As for the Brunios, they were very much distressed
when they found out that the chipmunk was
gone. By spying, they discovered some of Eepersip's
strange habits. Then, early one morning, they
took their little kitten--the twins had rather
stupidly named her "White," for her colour--up
to the field where Eepersip had her home, let her
go very near Eepersip’s burrow, and then ran away
quickly before the kitten could find them. Well,
White didn’t care much about being left in the
dewy grass, bewilderedly shaking first one paw,
then another. But presently Eepersip came out of
her burrow with Chippy. Seeing the patch of white,
Eepersip thought the kitten was an exceptionally
late bit of snow left on the grass. But no, it certainly
had not been there the last time she had
looked. And then she realized that it was altogether
too late for any snow. Darting up to it, she
found the little kitten, so snow-white, with the
blue-grey eyes like little moonstones, gazing pitifully
up at her. Because she thought the kitten had
been a patch of snow, Eepersip named her Snow-flake.
</p><p class="calibre13">She took her, shivering with the wetness of the
dew, into her burrow, and found, much to her surprised,
that Chippy recognized her and sprang at
her in great delight. The truth of the matter was <span><span id="calibre_link-54" data-page-number="39" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/47" data-page-index="47" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/47"></span></span>that Chippy had often seen the kitten during his
captivity, and had played many a happy game with
her in his cage.
</p><p class="calibre13">Caireen and Flitterveen had thought when they
let the kitten go that Eepersip, seeing a new animal,
would give them back Chippy. Not so! Eepersip
would have two animals than one. Besides,
she saw how dearly the two loved each
other, and would not have parted them for anything
now. The Brunios had been disappointed
enough at losing Chippy--and now they had lost
the kitten too!
</p><p class="calibre13">It was now summer, and the Brunios--Mr.
Brunio, Caireen, and Flitterveen--decided to
climb Eiki-ennern Peak and try to get back their
kitten. They wandered around a little while and at
last came to a sunny place on the edge of the
woods. It was a very grassy spot, all surrounded
with blackberry-bushes just blossoming. Near its
edge was Chippy asleep, and in the middle was
Snowflake washing herself and playing with the
dry oak-leaves that swirled about in the breeze.
Snowflake started back a little at the sound of
whispering voices, and then looked up. Eepersip
was not there, for she had gone off to find some
sweet bulbs and roots
</p><p class="calibre13">"Come on, White, dear!" called Caireen. <span><span id="calibre_link-55" data-page-number="40" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/48" data-page-index="48" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/48"></span></span>But Snowflake did not know her old name since
Eepersip had changed it.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Here, Sugar-bowl!" said Mr. Brunio. (He
had got rather used to calling her that, because she loved
sugar and had a habit of pawing into the
sugar-bowl to get it). This was a trifle more familiar,
and she took a step forward.
</p><p class="calibre13">"That's the way!" said Flitterveen, encouraging
her. "Come on!"
</p><p class="calibre13">Snowflake took back the step.
</p><p class="calibre13">They grew impatient; yet some of their calls
were encouraging that Snowflake could hardly
resist creeping through the briers to their feet.
Pretty soon she touched Chippy with her nose. He
awoke, yawned two or three times, and, when he
saw the people there, blatantly pattered of into the
woods. Now Snowflake sat very still, in spite of all
their coaxings, for she knew that help was coming.
And she didn't have long to wait, for in a moment
Eepersip came running up with Chippy in her
arms. With a beautiful leap she cleared the briers
and, taking up Snowflake, cleared them again and
vanished into the woods.
</p><p class="calibre13">Life for Chippy and Snowflake was great fun
during the time when Mr. Brunio, sometimes with
the twins, was coming up to the brier-patch and
trying to entice Snowflake away. In the afternoons, <span><span id="calibre_link-56" data-page-number="41" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/49" data-page-index="49" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/49"></span></span>though the two little animals were glad to stay in
the brier-patch, Eepersip generally took them
along with her when she went anywhere, for she
thought that possibly Mr. Brunio might come up
with an ax to chop down the briers. In this Eepersip
proved wise, for, about the third day that Mr.
Brunio and the children had been coming up Eiki-Ennern
Peak to rescue Snowflake, Mr. Brunio did
bring an ax; But this time Eepersip had taken the
little animals out with her; they had gone exploring,
finding sweet roots and brilliant berries.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip spent that summer in continual fits of
dancing, laughing, and merriment. She had never
before been so happy. Every day she felt as though
loved the animals, birds, and butterflies&mdash;everything
of Nature&mdash;more than the day before.
She loved to see the same birds coming back this
year. Above all she loved the delicate butterflies
with wings of all colours. She would lie in the
meadow for hours and watch what was happening.
She could imagine miniature cities in the air, and
saw little butterflies and birds constantly going and
coming from them. There were cities on the
ground too, where orchestras of grasshoppers and
crickets played in the grass.
</p><p class="calibre13">She sometimes made up words for her melodies&mdash;little
songs of Nature. She would sing them <span><span id="calibre_link-57" data-page-number="42" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/50" data-page-index="50" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/50"></span></span>over and over, sometimes ringingly, sometimes in a murmur.
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
Buttercups are smiling<br class="calibre3" />
<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>To see the butterflies<br class="calibre3" />
Feathering so softly,<br class="calibre3" />
<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>Rainbowing the skies....<br class="calibre3" />
</p><p class="calibre13">The wind is snowing butterflies,<br class="calibre3" />

<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>The sun is raining flowers.<br class="calibre3" />
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
She told the deer that <i class="calibre10">she</i> felt like a butterfly, and that the wind was snowing <i class="calibre10">her</i> when she danced. And then she gave them handfuls of lush grass.

<p class="calibre13">At the end of that first winter Mrs. Eigleen began to feel ill. No one knew what was the matter with her. She spent the spring in continual weeping and hysterics. Towards the summer she began to feel seriously ill. They had had several different doctors in to see her, but none of them could find out exactly what the matter was, for she refused to tell anyone anything, even though she said she <span><span id="calibre_link-58" data-page-number="43" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/51" data-page-index="51" data-page-quality="4" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/51"></span></span>herself knew. One afternoon she called her friends round her and bade them take her over to the meadow, where they would surely see Eepersip. They took her out, but never a trace of Eepersip did they see. And Mrs. Eigleen kept on having her fits of weeping all through the summer, even more frequently than before.
</p><p class="calibre13">Now, by this time Mrs. Eigleen, her husband, and all her neighbours had found out that Eepersip had taken White away from the Brunios; for once they had been out in the field and seen Eepersip. She was crowned with a wreath on which butterflies were clustering in bunches, like grapes; and Chippy and Snowflake were frolicking about her. The Eigleens, the Ikkisfields, and the Wraspanes went down the meadow and to Mr. Brunio's house (for some of them knew the Brunios and recognized the kitten), and he related his adventures. That very afternoon they went back to the meadow and chased Eepersip, but they couldn't catch her, for she took up Snowflake and Chippy and mounted a doe, who bore them off like the wind.
</p><p class="calibre13">The next day they tried again: It was dawn, and Eepersip was lying in the centre of the meadow with Snowflake and Chippy by her side. She had had her breakfast, but she lay on the grass  <span><span id="calibre_link-59" data-page-number="44" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/52" data-page-index="52" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/52"></span></span>watching the sun rise and send away the shadows to
right and left, flushing the sky with delicate pink
and yellow. The deer were still laying down. Eepersip
heard a sound of voices talking, followed by a
roar of laughter; and instantly, of course, she grew
suspicious. She heard: "Mr. Wraspane, will you
come with me?" "Certainly, Mr. Eigleen."
"Mrs. Ikkisfield, you come with me. We are the
ones that are not so skilled in slyness. We will go
up on the hill and guard there." "All right, Mrs.
Eigleen."
</p><p class="calibre13">As Eepersip lay there in the field, two men broke
out of the woods right near where she was lying.
She sprang to her feet, caught Chippy and Snowflake
in her arms, and ran. Before she could snatch
up the two little animals, Mr. Eigleen was just
able to seize her dress as she darted by him. But,
of course, the fern that he caught hold of came out
in his hand, and she ran along toward the hill&mdash;a
foolish thing to do, for she had just heard that
there were two people guarding it. Still, that was
just about the only thing that she could do, for
the other two, Mr. Ikkisfield and Mrs. Wraspane,
had also come out of the woods and blocked her
path.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip fled up on the hill and nearly ran int
Mrs. Eigleen and Mrs. Ikkisfield. Mrs. Eigleen <span><span id="calibre_link-60" data-page-number="45" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/53" data-page-index="53" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/53"></span></span>caught hold of Snowflake's tail, and Mrs. Ikkisfield
stepped in front of Eepersip, who dodged
desperately to one side, releasing her hold on the
kitten to prevent its being injured.
</p><p class="calibre13">But Eepersip was not going to give up her pet
just yet. She sped down the hill, knowing that the
others would soon be going to give the kitten back
to the Brunios. Through the big field she ran, with
Chippy clinging to her hair&mdash;down the other side
of the slope to the river, along its banks, across the
small bridge 'way down, and back to Mr. Brunio's
house on the other side.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip looked all about her for some place of
concealment. No one was in sight. Along the side
of the house there was a forest of blackberry-bushes,
which extended several yards and was unusually
dense and towering. The luscious black-and-purple
fruit was ripening, making it look even
more sheltering and mysterious. This patch was
in such a position that it had to be passed to
the front door, which was really on the side
of the house. Eepersip was pleased to find such a
convenient place. She sampled the berries with
satisfaction, always taking pains to see that no one
was coming. Then she wriggled inside and waited.
</p><p class="calibre13">Presently they all came along, Mrs. Ikkisfield
holding Snowflake. Eepersip had ready in her hand <span><span id="calibre_link-61" data-page-number="46" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/54" data-page-index="54" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/54"></span></span>a little sharp-pointed stick. She pushed it through
a tiny hole in Mrs. Ikkisfield's stocking. It hurt!
Mrs. Ikkisfield gave a little shriek of pain and
dropped Snowflake, who instantly put her paw on
a small fern which she saw&mdash;she couldn't see
Eepersip, but the fern was very familiar!&mdash;and
was pulled by Eepersip into the bush. When the
people saw that, they knew, of course, who was
near.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip started to crawl through the bush and
out the other side; but she heard Mr. Eigleen
whispering to the others to go around and stop
her. While they were watching, Mr. Brunio, who
had joined them, went back into the house and
fetched a net. It was woven of coarse, thick ropes,
but the meshes were quite small enough to hold the
kitten, and almost Chippy himself. (Mr. Brunio
had once been a fisherman; he had retired, but he
still had many nets with meshes of various sizes.)
They put this net over the bush and pegged it down
firmly, driving the pegs with the head of an ax
which Mr. Brunio brought out. Then they retreated
to a distance and watched.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip began working at the pegs; and the
chipmunk and the kitten to dig at the base of each
so that she might be able to pull them up more
easily. The pegs were really too big for Eepersip's <span><span id="calibre_link-62" data-page-number="47" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/55" data-page-index="55" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/55"></span></span>little hands to manage comfortably, but she didn’t
think of comfort in such danger as this, and she
worked boldly at the pegs with her nimble fingers.
After she had got two or three up, the Eigleens
and their friends came forward, took those pegs,
and put them down more firmly than before, so
that Eepersip had to begin all over.
</p><p class="calibre13">Although the people who were trying to capture
Eepersip and the kitten were naturally becoming
very hungry, they didn’t like to leave the bush unguarded.
But Mr. Brunio (who was exceptionally
hungry) said that he had many more such nets,
and that they could spread them all over the bush
and hurriedly get luncheon. If they put them down
very firmly, and ate rather fast, there wouldn't be
much chance of Eepersip's escaping before they
get out again. So they spread four more nets
over the bush and went in.
</p><p class="calibre13">Now was Eepersip's chance, and she worked
harder than ever. At last, with the aid of Chippy
and Snowflake, who helped a lot by digging around
the pegs, Eepersip got out of the first net and began
tugging at the second. She didn’t try to dig up
the pegs of this one: instead, all three tried to dig
under it, and at last they had made a hole large
enough for Eepersip to crawl through. The fibres
of the third net were rather rotten, so that  <span><span id="calibre_link-63" data-page-number="48" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/56" data-page-index="56" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/56"></span></span>Eepersip tore it easily. Each peg of the fourth and fifth
nets came up at one mighty yank; Mr. Brunio and
his helpers had put the last nets down in a great
hurry, in order to get their luncheon. Then Eepersip,
with the two little animals, fled from that
dread place, across the bridge and back to the
meadow, where she found a sheltered spot and
slept.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span> 
</p><p class="calibre13">The three families were much disgusted
themselves for not catching Eepersip and the kitten;
but they promised Mr. Brunio that
would try again. There followed a week of rainy
weather, during which they made no attempts, but
laid plans. As soon as the weather cleared, they
tried one of these plans; and Snowflake had a
narrow escape.
</p><p class="calibre13">It was in the middle of the night. The families
found Eepersip, with the two little animals, asleep
on the meadow. They took the kitten from her
arms. But as they did so, Eepersip herself woke
up, screamed loudly, and rushed after them. Then
they turned and came after her; and Eepersip was
bold enough and angry enough not to run until she
had rescued Snowflake. She came right up her <span><span id="calibre_link-64" data-page-number="49" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/57" data-page-index="57" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/57"></span></span>parents and seized Snowflake from the arms of the
horrified Mrs. Eigleen. Then Eepersip ran&mdash;and
fast, too!
</p><p class="calibre13">When she came to the edge of the woods she
made straight for a great pine. This tree she had
climbed about in often, and she knew its every
limb. In pitch dark she could find all its branches,
and sometimes she trusted to her memory rather
recklessly. She was as sure of this tree as of the
ground, even at night. She loved&mdash;she called it
<i class="calibre10">her</i> tree. A tree was, perhaps, not the easiest place
of concealment, but Eepersip thought that in this
way she would not have to run all over the meadow
in the dark&mdash;and she was very tired after her
usual all-day playing.
</p><p class="calibre13">There were no branches lower than seven feet
up. Eepersip made one leap, caught hold of a
branch, and swung herself up on to it. From that
branch she mounted higher and higher until she
reached the very top. It swayed gloriously, even
under her light weight, but to didn't creak as if
about to break. She sat up in the high crotch and
looked at the people so far below, through a mass
of black needles toil a mighty thickness of strong
limbs. It was a wonderful night. The sky was
spangled with stars of vivid silver. Not a cloud
was to be seen except on the western horizon, <span><span id="calibre_link-65" data-page-number="50" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/58" data-page-index="58" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/58"></span></span>where a bank was piling up rapidly, silhouetted
against the deep ultramarine of the sky, across
which the Milky Way made a path of radiance.
Eepersip, looking down among the powerful limbs,
felt as if she were part of the familiar tree.
</p><p class="calibre13">Poor Chippy and Snowflake were tired and
sleepy after what they had just been through.
Eepersip murmured kind words to them, while she
thought of all that she had been through herself.
She was not in the least dizzy, but she was tired,
and she knew that she must not go to sleep up
there.
</p><p class="calibre13">Then she saw that Mr. Eigleen had started to
climb the great tree. He got about half-way up
and then stopped. She remembered the place: it
had been difficult for her, too. There was not a
limb where he could put out a foot and step on it;
the next one was at the level of his neck. The question
was, how could he get on to this limb? He
didn't have the strength to pull himself up to it
the way Eepersip had done. He tried for a long
time; but his caution proved too much for him.
At last, in despair, he descended; and the people
went away, leaving Eepersip in peace.
</p><p class="calibre13">As soon as they were well out of sight and hearing,
Eepersip came down in a series of leaps from
limb to limb. At length she got to the bottom, <span><span id="calibre_link-66" data-page-number="51" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/59" data-page-index="59" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/59"></span></span>where the last limb was seven feet from the
ground. She braced herself as firmly as she could
on this, and then she jumped. It was a marvellous
jump in the dark, and she landed on the ground
unhurt, though very tired and covered with bits of
bark. "My, that was a dreary adventure!" she
said sleepily, as she crawled off to find a place to
sleep
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">Eersip saw no more of the Brunios or her
parents, and she decided that they had given up
chasing her and Snowflake for the winter&mdash;a winter
which she and her two friends spent undisturbed,
playing with the leaves and shadows.
</p><p class="calibre13">It was spring&mdash;spring before the third summer
that Eepersip was to spend wild&mdash;and the golden
sun melted away the last patches of snow from off
the bare rocks and from round the pool, where it
had lodged between them. It was warm, although
a wind was blowing&mdash;the delicious wind of
spring. This marvellous spring air made her blood
course quickly. She felt extremely happy and
dancy. Her body seemed to her lighter than ever,
in spite of its strength. Her spirit was so joyous
that she could not express it in action; she had to <span><span id="calibre_link-67" data-page-number="52" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/60" data-page-index="60" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/60"></span></span>let part of it out in song. But song, however light
and happy, could not quite express Eepersip's feeling.
She danced, and she sang, and she leaped aloft
for joy.
</p><p class="calibre13">As the season advanced, she crowned herself
with sweet-smelling flowers, and the butterflies
came and lit on them. She went up the pool
wearing her fluttering crown, and there she saw
the flowers that had come to bloom. There was
iris, purple and gold&mdash;huge blossoms which reminded
Eepersip of the ocean as she had seen it, so
far away, on the first day of her wandering. In
a soft bed of green moss she found a little pink-and-white
flower that she didn't know, bell-shaped
and very fragrant. There were wild-rose-buds
there, too, and never had Eepersip seen so many
butterflies as were on those roses. They bordered
the tiny beach, mingled with the tenderly uncurling
green ferns. The delicate red leaf-buds on the
maple-trees were now developing into tiny emerald
leaves. And there were ever so many other treasures
Nature there.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip played little happy games with all the
creatures of the field. One game she played with
the crickets. A cricket would be hiding in a certain
place, and when Eepersip danced by he would buzz
out of the grass into her face; she would pretend <span><span id="calibre_link-68" data-page-number="53" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/61" data-page-index="61" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/61"></span></span>to be startled and would run from the spot. She
played another game with the grasshoppers. One
would be hiding, and Eepersip would come dancing
by with her eyes shut. Then the grasshopper
would whirr out of the grass and alight on her
hand. When she opened her eyes she would shake
her hand and try to get rid of him, all in fun, of
course. Then sh e played two lovely games with the
happy butterflies. She would let a butterfly alight
on her hand, to which she would then give a violent
jerk, so that the butterfly was sent sailing into the
air; then, without a motion of the wings, he would
come sailing back to Eepersip's hand. This they
would do again and again. When she tired of this
game, Eepersip would crown herself with the
sweetest flowers she could find, and then flocks of
butterflies would try to alight on her wreath as
she danced. There were never enough flowers for
all of them; some were always fluttering around
Eepersip's head, trying to find a nestling-place,
and others were safely folded in the blossoms.
</p><p class="calibre13">One of the thrilling hours of Eepersip's happy
life that summer was when she lay in the meadow
watching the sky and all the swallows circling.
Snowflake and Chippy were frolicking gayly in
the short, dry grass, chasing leaves. Now Chippy
snuggled up to Eepersip. Snowflake kept on  <span><span id="calibre_link-69" data-page-number="54" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/62" data-page-index="62" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/62"></span></span>playing; she was crouched on her little white belly,
playing with a dry brown leaf, and when it drifted
beyond her reach she would spring after it. Eepersip
watched her in a dreamy way. Now Snowflake
cast the dead leaf away, having torn it to shreds,
and played with other things. Sometimes she would
rear herself up into the air; at other times she
would run with little tripping steps over to Eepersip,
as if something had frightened her; again she
would rush round and round Eepersip in a wide
circle, and finally she would settle down to play
with another dead leaf. It made Eepersip glad to
hear the kitten's little pattering feet on the grass;
she knew how madly Snowflake was frolicking, but
she did not share in the play&mdash;instead, with a
dreamy happiness, she watched the sky.
</p><p class="calibre13">Another day in this summer was even happier.
It was in July, and Eepersip was lying in a part of
the meadow where there weren't many deer, so
that the grass was long, soft, and green instead of
stiff and short. Snowflake and Chippy were frolicking
around in it, but again Eepersip was not thinking
of them. She wast thinking the swallows that
flew over her, and the way the sun shone on their
breasts, making them glitter like silver. The
crickets were chirping, and the grasshoppers were
accompanying them, and they were both very <span><span id="calibre_link-70" data-page-number="55" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/63" data-page-index="63" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/63"></span></span>happy. The frogs croaked bass songs from the
pool&mdash;the cool, green frogs! The birds were singing
merrily, and the butterflies passed over Eepersip's
head in flocks&mdash;butterflies of white and
purple and blue and yellow, little ones of copper-green,
and big ones of orange and red. Some of
them flew with short, quick flirts of the wings,
others with long strokes which swept them through
the air. The gauzy dragonflies, too, flew over her.
Everything thrilled Eepersip's happy, tireless eyes.
</p><p class="calibre13">The bees hummed their way low over the long
green grass, and Chippy and Snowflake leaped
high in the air when they passed. Eepersip had
taught the two little animals not to catch the creatures
of the field, and before long all the birds
loved Snowflake&mdash;something that few kittens
have yet attained. But Snowflake and Chippy liked
to pretend to catch the bees, and sometimes they
went so far as to hold them: on the ground with
their paws, very gently, not hurting them at all.
Snowflake and Chippy lay in the grass, reaching
and touching anything that took their fancy. When
the wind blew they would leap up at the clover-blossoms
that nodded. They played hide-and-seek,
leaping over the grasses and chasing each other in
and out of their hiding-places. The long grass
offered a splendid place of concealment. Chippy <span><span id="calibre_link-71" data-page-number="56" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/64" data-page-index="64" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/64"></span></span>would scurry behind a big sheltering tuft, seeming
to Snowflake to have vanished in mid-air. Snowflake
would poke about and run in such bewildering
circles that it tired them looking at each other.
Soon they would get so mixed up that they
wouldn’t know which of them was supposed to be
hiding, and it often happened that they were both
hiding at the same time, or both searching.
</p><p class="calibre13">This was for Eepersip the happiest of that summer's
hours in the field. Something fresh and fragrant
in the air made breathing a delight; it almost
lifted her off the ground, and she let forth a glorious
burst of song.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">It was a cold, frisky day in October, and Eepersip,
even in her warm coat, had to keep moving.
Snowflake and Chippy were frolicking and playing
games with each other. Eepersip had taught them
how to shake hands, and this they were practising.
A leaf had settled on Snowflake's head like a
brown crown, and she was trying vigorously to get
it off. But no, the leaf was curled firmly around her
small, dainty ears. She got wilder and wilder in
her amusing efforts. She dashed round and round.
She reached after it with her forepaws. All in vain! <span><span id="calibre_link-72" data-page-number="57" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/65" data-page-index="65" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/65"></span></span>She could not get rid of that persistent leaf. But
there! a gust of cold wind sent it flying from her
head, to be instantly lost in a whirl of others which
the wind had started up. Snowflake dashed among
them madly, and played with them, trying to catch
them all at the same time. But at last she stopped
her foolish efforts and came quietly back to rest.
</p><p class="calibre13">In November the first snow of the winter fell.
The flakes came thick and fast, like white and silver
butterflies dancing, flying. Eepersip took them
in her hands and noticed how each flake had its
own shape, which was never found again. During
that day in October Snowflake had worn a brown
crown of a dead leaf, but now she wore a white
one. The snow didn't show much on the white fur
of the kitten, but Chippy's autumn brown was soon
covered with a mossy blanket of it. The flakes
whirled down thicker and faster than ever, and
Chippy tried to jump at them all. The playmates
could hide in the snow now, for if they got far
enough apart they couldn't see each other. They
tried to capture the snowflakes, but they found
that this made their paws even wetter.
</p><p class="calibre13">In spite of all this merriment, Eepersip had a
tightly sad feeling in her heart. The night before,
she had seen the sea; and it had looked <i class="calibre10">so</i> glorious
that she felt as if&mdash;as if she would Ike to go to it. <span><span id="calibre_link-73" data-page-number="58" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/66" data-page-index="66" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/66"></span></span>She loved the meadow so much that this would be
almost impossible for her. Yet she knew that, in
spite of her love for the meadow. her longing for
the sea would grow, and that one day she must
leave her present home. All this made her rather
sad. But she tried to be happy&mdash;to share the joy
of her two little friends, and the joy of having the
little fairy things come whirling down upon her.
She played all day in the meadow with her friends,
and when the evening fell they went back to the
burrow and slept in peace till morning.
</p><p class="calibre13">In this way the winter passed. Every evening at
sunset Eepersip would go over to the edge of the
meadow and gaze long upon the sea, with the brilliant
sunset colours reflected in it. And each time
she looked it seemed so beautiful, so beautiful! and
each time she tried to go it, it seemed as if the
ground of the meadow was a great magnet to her
feet.
</p><p class="calibre13">The spring came, and with it the flowers and
leaves.
</p><p class="calibre13">One night Eepersip woke up to find the full
moon as if hanging in the sky. A few faint stars
could be seen. She tried to go to sleep, but could
not. At last she got up from her bed of moss. The
dew lay thick on the grass, which slushed deliciously
against her bare feet. All entranced with <span><span id="calibre_link-74" data-page-number="59" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/67" data-page-index="67" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/67"></span></span>the beauty of the night, she ran lightly over to the
spot where she often had a view of the sea. And
she beheld it with the full moon reflected in it&mdash;a
globe of soft silver, shimmering and quivering
in the unstill waters. This time it was too much for
Eepersip. She could stand it no longer&mdash;her heart
gave way. She decided that the next morning she
would satisfy her longing.
</p><p class="calibre13">And so, just after dawn, she left her beautiful
home in the field and journeyed toward the ocean.
She went to the edge of the meadow with a herd
of deer daintily tripping after her. She turned and
cried: "Good-bye, O deer! for probably I shall
never see you again." She kissed the ground of the
meadow, and she wept to think that she was leaving
it; but she knew that her love for the sea had
become greater than her love for the meadow.
And then she went away&mdash;sadly, yet happy at the
prospect of a new and beautiful life by the foaming,
churning rocks and the white-capped waves.

<p class="calibre13">dimmer in her mind, and the memory of how
the sea bad looked grew brighter. She couldn't see
it now, for the was in a valley; but she knew that
she was going in the right direction. The spring
breeze was blowing; it was not cold, and the
breeze stirred the air gently, so that it wasn't hot.
Occasional whiffs from the meadow came to
Eepersip with that breeze; but when the had gone
about two miles this fragrance ceased.
</p><p class="calibre13">That afternoon she came into a great forest
where strange. mysterious shadows passed back
and forth in a frightening way. She hurried on as
fast as she could, but she had to spend a night in it&mdash;one
alarming, terrible night. The next day she
came out, torn and bedraggled with fighting her
way through the dense thickets. Several times she
had to cross rivers&mdash;some of them without a
bridge, though luckily none of these was over her
depth. Another day had passed. Nightfall found
her wearily climbing a very high hill. The reflection
of the moon showed her where the ocean was.
It seemed hardly any nearer than before! <span><span id="calibre_link-77" data-page-number="62" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/70" data-page-index="70" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/70"></span></span>The third morning she descended into a rich and
fertile valley. A small brook was winding down it,
and where the weeping willows dipped into the
current it bubbled and sang. This valley was the
broadest that Eepersip had yet gone through. But
after a long time she came out of it against a high,
precipitous cliff. Up the side of this she climbed,
digging her toes into the cracks between the rocks,
At last she got to the top; and a long, weary climb
it had been. She was now on a grassy hill where
bloomed daisies shining like stars, and little butter-cups
of gold. There were butterflies, too, with
brilliant wings, and they hovered and fluttered
over the flowers. And lo! there was the ocean,
nearer now, with the sun shining on it; and Eepersip
could see the surf rolling and foaming. Shrill
cries pierced the air&mdash;the cries of birds, of seagulls
swooping inland in wide circles. And as
went on through the waving grass she could smell
the delicious salt air of the sea.
</p><p class="calibre13">But, alas, she met with a hindrance. Between,
her and the coast there was a valley extending for
miles, and poor Eepersip would have to clamber
down a precipitous cliff, through the valley, and up
another cliff. Down she went, rather unwillingly
but knowing that she would get there sometime.
At last she came to the bottom. It wasn't so bad <span><span id="calibre_link-78" data-page-number="63" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/71" data-page-index="71" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/71"></span></span>down there&mdash;there was a lovely lakelet at which
she refreshed herself with a drink; it was grassy,
and there were flowers. But it was stiflingly hot.
There was a patch of pine woods here and there,
but it was hot even in the shade of the great trees.
</p><p class="calibre13">She stumbled on in the almost blinding heat,
clambering up the other great precipice&mdash;the
wall of the valley. From the top she looked down,
and, seeing again that ponderous cliff, she wondered
how she could ever have got up it. Then she
lay down on the grass, and in a moment was asleep.
</p><p class="calibre13">When she awoke, the strong wind was blowing
again. It made her almost fly through the cold,
salty air. Before her was the long-sought ocean,
with the waves rolling and the gulls swooping,
diving and screaming. She flew; her feet could not
stay still. She was tired no longer&mdash;she didn’t
feel the smallest effects of her wearisome journey.
</p><p class="calibre13">Suddenly she heard a sound&mdash;the magical
sound of the waves as they crashed on the rocks.
In they would come, pounding, roaring, breaking
upon the shore. The foam and spume would fly
back and leap up into the air. Everything sounded
strange&mdash;stranger than anything Eepersip had
ever heard. No words can describe what she imagined.
She never had had such a lot of emotions in
her head at the same time. She tried to describe <span><span id="calibre_link-79" data-page-number="64" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/72" data-page-index="72" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/72"></span></span>them to herself, but soon gave it up as useless. She
thought: "Here I am; I see it; you don't need to
tell me about it!" And then she realized that she
was alone, knowing in her own mind what it was
like, yet unable to stop wishing that she could describe
the hollow, ringing sound. Was she becoming
homesick? No! it was sheer delight.
</p><p class="calibre13">For a moment she paused. Then she bounded
through the yellow sand, and, ever going faster
and faster, she came to the edge of her sea. Her
longing had been fulfilled.
</p><p class="calibre13">This beach was almost overhung at one end by
a great shelf of rock. The sand was glistening with
shells of all colours and bordered with sea-weeds
washed up. Tiny sand-pipers' tracks ran all over
it. Eepersip stayed there a long time, gazing into
the waves, gazing at everything.
</p><p class="calibre13"><br class="calibre3" />
The rock-ledge at one end of the beach had been
catching her eye for some time. She watched how
fearlessly the gulls plunge on quivering wings,
down, down, then rose again, covered with silvery
drops, to fly here and there. Then she would look
back at the little precipice. She thought: "<i class="calibre10">I</i> cannot
fly! <i class="calibre10">They</i> do it from the air, but I cannot. I can
do it from the precipice! Why not? "Then, aloud:
"I <i class="calibre10">will</i> be a bird&mdash;I <i class="calibre10">will</i> do it!"
</p><p class="calibre13">She walked back to the point where the cliff <span><span id="calibre_link-80" data-page-number="65" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/73" data-page-index="73" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/73"></span></span>towered from the beach. She climbed up. She
selected, in the water so far below, a place that was
free from the treacherous-looking rocks. Then,
swaying her arms a moment and plucking up high
courage, she gave a flying leap and landed in the
deep water.
</p><p class="calibre13">Another miracle! She had never had a chance
to swim before, but somehow she did it naturally
now. It was an instinct in her to kick with her legs
and throw out her arms in the right way. Fortunately
she had landed in the place without rocks.
Shaking herself in imitation of the gulls, so that
silvery drops flew from her in all directions, she
began to swim about. She played in the water for a
time, entranced, singing as she had never done
before, even in the meadow. After a while she
came out, all shining, laughing and dancing. But it
was then too late in the day to play any more; so
she lay down on the sand, well out of reach of the
tide, and slept, with the murmuring of the sea in
ears all night.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">I had been high tide; but the tide was now
going out, and near the beach the tops of the great
rocks were appearing. To Eepersip, who <span><span id="calibre_link-81" data-page-number="66" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/74" data-page-index="74" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/74"></span></span>had never before been near the ocean, these things
which happened every day were strange and delightful,
and she could not look at them enough.
Each wave was pure blue, topped and trimmed
with spray. As the waters drew back Eepersip had
to retreat; for the low tide revealed more and
more rocks, and the spray that hit upon them flew
back farther and farther. Gradually they were left
bare and dry, and Eepersip arranged sea-weeds
and sea-plants in the little pools left in their hollows.
When, at last, high tide came in, she sorrowed
to watch them become part of the sea again.
But she knew, of course, that when the tide went
out other pools would be left&mdash;perhaps more
than there had been before.
</p><p class="calibre13">Among the rocks at the back of the beach
Eepersip found a pool made by leaping spray from
a storm. She trimmed it with sea-weeds of brown
and green. She took some of the dried low-tide
snails from the rocks around it and cast them into
the sea. With her hands she caught some sluggish
yet pretty little fishes and put them into her pool.
As she was doing this she noticed how the tide was
coming in&mdash;she had been so intent upon her task
that she hadn't seen it. It was now almost up to
her. She stopped what she was doing and watched
it anxiously, afraid that it was going to reach her <span><span id="calibre_link-82" data-page-number="67" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/75" data-page-index="75" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/75"></span></span>pool. But, to her great joy, it didn't. The waves
lapped as if they wanted it very much, but they
couldn't quite touch it; and Eepersip, worried no
longer, continued her happy playing.
</p><p class="calibre13">In this way the days passed, with something new
all the time. But she did not forget her little pool.
She tended it, putting in fresh plants and rocks,
and replacing a fish if it died.
</p><p class="calibre13">She slept in a crevice in the rocks at the end of
the beach.There was a tunnel under the rocks that
the water had cut; if she crept to the farther end,
no tide could reach her. There was a spring in the
pasture in back of the beach, about a hundred
yards away, and there Eepersip got her supply of
fresh water. It made a merry brooklet which ran
bubbling down a small hill and into the sea. When
it was stormy she had a habit of merely snuggling
under the rocks as far as she could go, to watch
the glistening white-caps and listen to the crashing
surf. But before she had seen many storms she
stayed out when they weren't too severe, and sometimes
played about in the waves&mdash;and she liked
to be ducked.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">In her explorations along the shore one day
Eepersip found a great raft, made from  <span><span id="calibre_link-83" data-page-number="68" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/76" data-page-index="76" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/76"></span></span>interlacing twigs and plastered over with clay and pitch,
Here and there great water-soaked ropes bound it
firmly. It had been washed up on the shore, and
from a long period in the sea, had become terribly
slimy and water-logged. Eepersip hauled it to the
water to see if it would hold her weight, but it
sank immediately. So she let it dry off in the sun
for a long time; and at last, when it had become
quite dry, she tried again. This time it held her.
It started drifting off to sea with her on it, but she
quickly slipped off and took it to shore again. A
few days afterward Eepersip found a board, about
three feet long and broad enough to serve perfectly
as a paddle.
</p><p class="calibre13">That was what she had wanted. She hauled the
raft out to her depth, climbed on to it, took the
paddle, and pushed off merrily.
</p><p class="calibre13">Under strong strokes the water whirled and
rushed, and the raft pushed through it. Sometimes
she came to a sand-flat, and again to such a deep
place that when she looked down all she could see
was menacing shadows. Once the raft came into a
shoal of carmine-coloured fishes with very long
pointed fins. Of course, they scattered in all directions
as she came amongst them.
</p><p class="calibre13">When she had started it was dawn. By midday,
with the help of a favourable wind, she was out <span><span id="calibre_link-84" data-page-number="69" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/77" data-page-index="77" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/77"></span></span>of sight of land. Then she saw that, if she were
going to get back to the beach by evening, she must
hurry and use her remaining daylight in that direction.
So she turned about, with great difficulty because
of the wind, and then she started homeward.
But everything that had before been favourable
was now against her; with her clumsy craft she
could make no headway, and the waves were rising
higher all the time. So she gave up, thinking that
possibly the wind would soon change or calm down
altogether. But this did not happen.
</p><p class="calibre13">She was dashed about wildly, ever going farther
from land, and seeing nothing save the unlimited
expanse of rough water. Yet, even in her fright,
she enjoyed it. She was not hurt at all, and she had
only to cling tight to the raft. The sensation of
being so dashed set and of riding up and down
on the waves was glorious.
</p><p class="calibre13">All the same, when it began to grow darker,
darker, the wind remaining steady, she began to
wish she had not ventured forth, but had stayed in
shelter and safety at her little beach. She had always
had great fun watching the storms, the high
spray, the wind-tossed gulls; but now she saw that
she had wished for rather too much.
</p><p class="calibre13">It became steadily blacker, and still she was
borne on, making no resistance now, for she saw <span><span id="calibre_link-85" data-page-number="70" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/78" data-page-index="78" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/78"></span></span>how useless it was. By the faint remaining light
from where the sun had set, she saw ahead of her
a dark pointed object rising out of the water. She
knew that it was a rock; and, afraid of being
dashed against it, she began resisting with her
paddle. Extreme fright made her strokes powerful,
and she actually managed to slow up the raft
a little. She came gently against the edge of the
rock, fastened her raft to it by means of one of
the ropes, and climbed up to its peak. From there,
the sea, with its wild waves, was like the sky, full
of weird cloud-caves, fringed with light from a
hidden moon.
</p><p class="calibre13">She looked for a long time; she looked steadily.
And then, not far off, she saw a dark mass which,
outlined against the deep blue of the night sky,
appeared to be land&mdash;blessed land! She realized
that the waves were going straight toward it. With
a cry of joy, she unfastened her raft, leaped upon it,
gave a useless push with her paddle, and went on.
</p><p class="calibre13">Soon she came to the shore&mdash;a smooth beach,
She pulled up her raft, well out of reach of the
advancing tide, and started for the bushes to find
a place to sleep. For the first time since night had
fallen, she noticed the wondrous beauty of the
moon, almost full, and the stars that showed
faintly their silvery faces. She crawled in among <span><span id="calibre_link-86" data-page-number="71" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/79" data-page-index="79" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/79"></span></span>the bushes, and, watching all these lovely things
and listening to the soft murmuring of the waves,
which were now calm again, she fell into a deep,
delicious sleep.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">The next day the sea was absolutely calm. The
sun was shining brilliantly on the water, making it
dance and sparkle. Even Eepersip, who was so
accustomed to waking in a different place from
where she had been yesterday, was surprised to
find herself where she was, and she had to rub her
eyes hard to make sure that she was not dreaming.
Then the whole adventure came back to her&mdash;the
raft, the windy night, the raging sea, and the
happy landing on this shore. There was her raft,
lying on the beach just where she had left it.
</p><p class="calibre13">She got up and started to explore along the
beach, but suddenly she stopped short in her
tracks; for there, covered with climbing vines and
bordered with bright little flowers, was a cottage&mdash;a
little cottage in the midst of its forest of green
leaves and bushes. Beautiful thought it was, for a
moment tears came to Eepersip's eyes, Exactly so
had her own cottage looked; through all these
years she had remembered it&mdash;just how it was in
every detail. But this recollection soon passed <span><span id="calibre_link-87" data-page-number="72" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/80" data-page-index="80" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/80"></span></span>away, in the dismay of realizing that she had come
to an inhabited place It was all so beautiful&mdash;she
had wanted to stay and explore&mdash;and her hopes
were crushed!
</p><p class="calibre13">She stood stock-still for a long time, looking at
the cottage. Nothing stirred within, Everything
was quiet&mdash;oh! so quiet. Stealthily as a mouse
Eepersip crept toward it, opened the door, and
went in. A house, a detested house!&mdash;one of
those houses that she had run away from. Everything
came back to her&mdash;those foolish coverings
on the floors which they called carpets, at the windows
those useless decorations called curtains. To
think of it! when there was a carpet so much lovelier
of green grass or of white sand&mdash;and no
windows to be curtained!
</p><p class="calibre13">It was a delightful little room, all the same;
with a brownish woolly carpet, a small fireplace,
and little blue curtains of a delicate material. It
was quite deserted, so she decided not to let it
bother her.
</p><p class="calibre13">A small back door opened into the lovely woods
at the back of the house. Quickly Eepersip made
her way out into the open; and everything looked
twice as lovely as before. How light it was, with
all the world a window, instead of those silly little
peep-holes fringed about! How much more  <span><span id="calibre_link-88" data-page-number="73" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/81" data-page-index="81" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/81"></span></span>glowingeverything was! Oh, nothing in a house could
compare with the world of light that Eepersip
lived in!
</p><p class="calibre13">Out here, the sunbeams made shadows wherever
they struck; the birds twittered; the ripples
lapped the shore caressingly. Otherwise all was
still. But she was not thinking of the sea: she had
decided to explore the woodland, for she felt, in a
way, that it was her home. Following a little winding
path, she came through a grove of white pines
carpeted with needles and dotted with gnome-like
toadstools of red and yellow, looking very bright
and mysterious in that shady place. They were, to
Eepersip, like the traces of some elfin revel, perhaps
thrones of precious mineral. There were
great boulders, too, covered with grey-green lichens
some bearing aloft tiny cup-like blossoms of
pearly grey&mdash;the cups from which the feasters
had drunk their flower-wine. Seeing a lighter place
ahead, she knew that she was coming out of the
pine grove. A flood of pale green radiance greeted
her, as she stepped out of the dimness of the woods
into a meadow. White and yellow butterflies were
fluttering over it in great flocks, with wings shining.
Eepersip could hear birds chirping and singing.
She passed on through the meadow and came
again into woodlands, so thick now that hardly a <span><span id="calibre_link-89" data-page-number="74" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/82" data-page-index="82" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/82"></span></span>sunbeam could penetrate the dense canopy of
leaves.
</p><p class="calibre13">After a while she emerged into a clearing. In the
middle of it there was a pool, almost entirely surrounded
with dark green moss, very soft, overhung
by a boulder. It, too, had a covering of moss.
A tiny stream flowed silently and mysteriously into
the pool, which was so dark that Eepersip could
just see its floor of dark sand. On the bottom grew
strange star-leaved plants, and small fishes were
nibbling them. It was all very strange and magical,
it was so silent.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip stayed looking at this pool for a long
time, and then she decided to follow the little
brook which was trickling into it and see where it
came from. She followed it through deep woodland
for about three miles. All this way it was
sluggish. Then the land changed abruptly; and
Eepersip realized that she was climbing a steep
and rugged hill. She went up and up on a rough
path. It was very hard climbing, and she was becoming
tired. At last she got to the top, and her
happy eye looked back upon the way she had come.
</p><p class="calibre13">She saw from that high perch the pool, into
which she knew the little brook was trickling; the
blotches which were clumps and patches of dark
forest; the field, a mass of sparkling green light, <span><span id="calibre_link-90" data-page-number="75" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/83" data-page-index="83" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/83"></span></span>a brilliant illumination to the gloomy pine forests
around it; the cottage, a tiny brown speck in the
distance&mdash;and the sea, the billowing sea, with
the spots of foam, the towering waves, and that
green colour which the waves show when they are
agitated. She could even see the gulls, no bigger
than flies to her, swooping about; but she was too
far away to hear their shrill, excited screams. Long
and steadily she looked. And then&mdash;the strangest
thought Eepersip had ever experienced came to
her happy mind. "Forgetfulness!" she whispered
to herself. "Oh, I loved it so! and then, when it
happened that I came to the woodlands again, why&mdash;I
forgot it. I must go back instantly. But I am
<i class="calibre10">so</i> tired!"
</p><p class="calibre13">Each wave seemed to bring a pain to Eepersip's
heart, as she watched the sea, like emerald, stretching
away until it seemed to meet the blue sky. Suddenly
she sprang to her feet and started down like
a wild deer. Tearing through the woodlands,
through the dense thickets and the brambles, she
came out at last by the pool. But she had no eye for
all its beauties; she had no mind but for the sea.
She rested a second; than she was on her feet
again, plunging, rearing, fighting her way through
the woods. She came again, in the depths of exhaustion,
into that pool of light, the meadow.  <span><span id="calibre_link-91" data-page-number="76" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/84" data-page-index="84" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/84"></span></span>Unable to move, she sank down in the delicious soft
grass and watched the butterflies, like winged
jewels, swooping above. Then she fell into a deep,
heavy slumber.
</p><p class="calibre13">She was awakened by shrill cries which pierced
the air. Looking up, she saw a flock of gulls with
their long, narrow wings, the colour of foam, winging
their way toward the sea. Then she remembered
that she, too, was supposed to be winging
her way toward the sea, and she cried: "O happy
birds, I would I were among you, to go with
such flashing speed!" It seemed to her that the
sea was in her care, and that she, through foolish
forgetfulness, had wandered off from it&mdash;wandered
off from her guarding, leaving it to the
mercy of the beasts. Of course, if she had thought
a moment she would have seen how out of proportion
this was, but she could do nothing but blame
herself, and fancy a terrible monster who would
come and drink it all up in her absence. And she
began fighting and struggling against her tiredness,
until, with one desperate effort, she managed
to start running again. Then there was no stopping!
Her old strength seemed to come back, the
strength which she had had before starting her
woodland explorations&mdash;the result, as she
thought now, of a foolish desire. Once she had <span><span id="calibre_link-92" data-page-number="77" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/85" data-page-index="85" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/85"></span></span>started running again, her feet winged with a great
longing, she sped along the ground.
</p><p class="calibre13">Soon she passed the cottage; and then&mdash;there
was her sea again, just as she had left it, with the
waves beating the sandy shore. The gulls were
screaming and diving; everything was excited and
trembling. With a cry of ecstasy, Eepersip sprang
into the waves
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">Many happy days Eepersip spent here, living in
the vicinity of the hated little cottage. Since she
had come from the sea she had worn a mermaid dress
of sea-weeds, fastened at the neck by a white shell
with a hole through it. Her favourite play was
with the waves. She could swim now, even under
water, with a speed that surprised herself, and she
dived gracefully from all the rocks that she came
upon. But it was watching the sea that fascinated
her more than anything else. She would sit for
hours at a time on the rocks and listen to the waves
bellowing beneath her. Sometimes, when they were
very high, she would go down on the low rocks and
shout with delight when the white spray rushed
along and whirled itself up into her face. The
waves would wash her over and over and play with <span><span id="calibre_link-93" data-page-number="78" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/86" data-page-index="86" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/86"></span></span>her in their salty hands, and they seemed
rough and wild, something always guided her away
from the treacherous rocks which which they headed for.
</p><p class="calibre13">But she was born to wander, and it was not long
before she was off on her explorations again. One
sparkling day when the sun danced and glimmered
on the little ripples, Eepersip started to explore
the shore-line. Every sun-sparkle made her feel
happier and happier, and every breath of salty air
lighter, until at last she thought she must rise up
into the air on strong wings. After exploring quite
a while and finding nothing unusual, she sat down
on a rock. Her auburn curls goldened in the sunlight,
and her brown eyes sparkled.
</p><p class="calibre13">After she had rested a while, watching the
swooping sea-gulls, she decided to collect shells.
She went along the beach some way, picking up
shells and pebbles. But soon she tired of this and,
feeling very hot, flung herself into the sea and
played a while in the shallow water. Soon she
thought that she would like to take a long swim,
and she started out rapidly.
</p><p class="calibre13">The waves came in higher and higher and
brought with them great flocks of gulls sweeping
around in wide graceful circles and uttering
strange wild cries. Eepersip went on a long way
until she saw a great rock ahead, draped with sea-<span><span id="calibre_link-94" data-page-number="79" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/87" data-page-index="87" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/87"></span></span>weeds of a dark green which were floating up and
down with the motion of the waves. There were
many crabs and snails caught in them. She was
borne forward to the rock in a mighty wave, and,
clinging to it hard, she waited until the wave drew
back before climbing up. After she had rested
some time she noticed a shoal of shining little fishes
down in the water. Some were gold, some silver,
and some had bands of dark blue. They all had
ruby eyes. She watched them for a long time,
lying on her stomach on the rock. She observed
how they nosed down and fed on the oozy sea-plants
on the bottom, which were covered with
silver oxygen-bubbles. Also she could see, 'way
down there, lovely bright corals of all colours.
The water was rather muddy, but there was a current
coming in underneath, and before long it was
perfectly clear. The rock was tremendous, spreading
out beneath the surface and going down, down,
all covered with slime and sea-weeds. Eepersip was
fascinated watching those little fishes: she cared
for nothing else. How long might she have
watched them if the tide bad not been rising and
rising? Now it was touching her dress when a
ripple larger than the others came in. And now&mdash;a
flash of lightning down there in the shadows!
Eepersip could not realize what had happened. <span><span id="calibre_link-95" data-page-number="80" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/88" data-page-index="88" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/88"></span></span>Then she thought: a great brownish-green fish had
shot into the middle of the shoal, seized one of
them, and carried it off. It was so quick that Eepersip
could not think, until some time after it was all
over, what had really happened.
</p><p class="calibre13">She swam to the shore, but, to her surprise, it
was quite a different shore from where she had
started. She wondered where she was, She landed
on a beach of white sand, so fine that it was impossible
to hold. It was covered with shells of all
colours. These interested her for a long time, and
she piled up the whole beach with heaps of them
that she had collected, and had a beautiful time
playing with herself until&mdash;
</p><p class="calibre13">She saw some footprints! <i class="calibre10">Footprints!</i> They
came down on the beach and apparently into the
water, then out again, and disappeared in the
woods on a narrow path which Eepersip had not
noticed before.
</p><p class="calibre13">But she was not interested in where they went
to or where they came from. Her only thought was
to get away&mdash;away. It was then too late to go
out in the sea again&mdash;that is, far from shore. The
sun-was about to set. She would spend the night
there, and then she would wander again. So she
lay down and went to sleep.

not alone. A little golden-haired boy with sky-blue
eyes was looking at her. They looked at each other
for a long time.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Who are you?" he ventured at last.
</p><p class="calibre13">Here was a puzzler. "Eepersip Eigleen," she
answered. "I mean," she added doubtfully, "I
<i class="calibre10">was</i>."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Who are you now, then?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I don't know exactly."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Why don’t you?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I haven't any name now. I'm just somebody.
Have <i class="calibre10">you</i> any name?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes&mdash;Toby&mdash;Toby Carrenda."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Do you live here in the woods?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes."
</p><p class="calibre13">"In a house?"
</p><p class="calibre13">He looked at her curiously a moment; then he
said: "Yes, of course&mdash;don’t you?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"NO!"
</p><p class="calibre13">"How funny!"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes, it is." With a little reluctance&mdash;"Will
you play with me?"
</p><p class="calibre13">Strange: here was Eepersip, who detested people,
asking a little boy to play with her! It was
simply that she, not having seen any children for <span><span id="calibre_link-97" data-page-number="82" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/90" data-page-index="90" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/90"></span></span>a long time, was fascinated by this small boy who
seemed so unafraid of her and so natural.
</p><p class="calibre13">They wandered together on the beach and
picked up shells. Then Eepersip asked the little
boy if he liked to swim.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes," he said. "But do you think I'd better?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes&mdash;why not?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"All right."
</p><p class="calibre13">So he took off all his clothes and went in with
her, and they splashed each other and had a lovely
time. Eepersip wanted to make him a mermaid
dress, but there was no sea-weed right there, and
she didn't want to leave him. So they went into the
woods to find some ferns to make him a nymph
dress. She found a beautiful ferny glade, and sat
down and began to weave ferns together, talking
to him at the same time. When it was all done he
was delighted.
</p><p class="calibre13">"But, please," he said, "can't I have a shell,
too?"
</p><p class="calibre13">He touched the shell strung up on her sea-weed
dress. They looked all over the beach, and at last
they found another shell with a hole all the way
through. Then he was entirely content.
</p><p class="calibre13">They went into the woods together and picked
flowers, and Eepersip showed him how to make
fern dresses and how to weave wreaths of flowers. <span><span id="calibre_link-98" data-page-number="83" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/91" data-page-index="91" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/91"></span></span>They went into a grove of sunlit white pines and
danced there together. Finally the little tiny said:
"I'm hungry, Eeserpip."
</p><p class="calibre13">"It's <i class="calibre10">Eepersip</i>,” she said, "but it doesn’t matter
much. I'll find you something to eat." After a
while they found some flame-coloured berries, and
then Eepersip dug up some white roots of which
she was fond.
</p><p class="calibre13">The boy said: "This is jolly, it is. Is this the
way you get your food?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"always," she said.
</p><p class="calibre13">They played a while longer, and then someone
called.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip had a strange feeling at that moment.
She could not help feeling a certain reluctance
when she had first played with him; then she had
decided that he could not have anything to do with
the civilized people she hated so, He must be
separate from them, perhaps even a wild thing
like herself. She felt a sensation of horror when
the strange voice sounded. Then he was not alone&mdash;then
he lived in a house with other people!
</p><p class="calibre13">Startled, she cried: "Who's that?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"My mother," he answered.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Then you don't live here all by yourself?"
She had a bitter feeling of disappointment.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, no."

could think. Strange, that some magic power in
this child had already made her say as much as
had said.
</p><p class="calibre13">"I must go now," he said sorrowfully. "But I'll
be out this afternoon&mdash;I guess."
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip fell on her knees in front of him

me?"

</p><p class="calibre13">"Never mind why, but don't, will you?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I want to."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Then I won't play with you any more."
</p><p class="calibre13">"All right, Eepersip. I won't." She looked at
him doubtfully. "I promise you I won't. Goodbye.
I like you."
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip was delighted with her little friend.
She waited anxiously for him to come out. Presently
he came.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Eepersip," he said, "will you swim with me
again?"
</p><p class="calibre13">They went in again, and this time Eepersip <span><span id="calibre_link-100" data-page-number="85" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/93" data-page-index="93" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/93"></span></span>showed him how to swim, by holding hint up while
he kicked with his arms and legs. After a long time
he could swim a little bit by himself; and then
Eepersip took him to some rather high rocks and
showed him how to jump in. At first he wouldn't
do it alone; she took his hand and they jumped in
together. After that he did it alone, and screamed
with laughter when he came up. Then Eepersip
showed him how to go in head first, and he had
so much faith in her that he tried it right off. Although
he went rather flat, he liked it very much.
The next time Eepersip bent him 'way over before
he went in, and he straightened out and hit the
water clean as an arrow. That was much better, he
said.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip asked him what his mother had said
about the fern dress, for he had gone in no quickly
that he had forgotten his own clothes. He said that
she had asked him about it, and he had said that
he found it. Eepersip thanked him for not telling
about her.
</p><p class="calibre13">But she was discovered in spite of her caution.
One day when they were playing in the woods,
Mrs. Carrenda came out and found them. Eepersip
dashed for the waves immediately, in spite of
the fact that Toby's mother called: "Don't run
away, little girl; I won't hurt you!"
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-101" data-page-number="86" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/94" data-page-index="94" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/94"></span></span>But Toby began to cry bitterly. "Why did you
send her away, Mother?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I didn't, Toby. She ran as soon as I came.
Who is she?"
</p><p class="calibre13">That Toby did not answer. There were two instincts
equally strong struggling within him&mdash;one
to obey his mother, and the other to do what the
strange girl asked him to with the threat of refusing
to play with him if he did not.
</p><p class="calibre13">"I can't tell you, Mother," he said courageously.
It would have been as true if he had said
"I don't know," for he knew nothing but her
name, after all. However, he never stopped to
think that knowing her name was not all there was
to knowing <i class="calibre10">her</i>.
</p><p class="calibre13">Mrs. Carrenda wisely pursued the matter no
further; but she determined to keep watch.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip was much more cautions after this. She
was always on the lookout. Several times Toby
asked her why she didn't want to be seen. But she
would not answer him. She was, however, very
kind in all other respects. Several times Mrs. Carrenda
found Toby playing with her, but never
spoke or let him know. She saw that Eepersip
played nicely with him and that they liked each
other much; no she did not interfere. Once, however,
she put her hands suddenly on Eepersip's <span><span id="calibre_link-102" data-page-number="87" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/95" data-page-index="95" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/95"></span></span>shoulders from behind and said kindly: "Little
girl, don't be afraid of me."
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip sprang to her feet, stared wildly a
moment, and then dashed off straight to the sea.
But for fear of making Toby very unhappy, Mrs.
Carrenda never questioned him about her.
</p><p class="calibre13">She and her husband had many anxious conferences
together. Her husband thought that it was
exceedingly risky to let Toby play so unwatched
with Eepersip, but Toby's mother did not feel that
way at all. Then they talked over the matter of
who she was.
</p><p class="calibre13">One day Eepersip was peeping into the house to
see if she could find Toby, for he had not been out
to play with her. Looking into the dining-room,
she sow him there, eating luncheon with Mr. and
Mrs. Carrenda. They were talking anxiously, and
she was curious, and listened.
</p><p class="calibre13">"I have it," said Mr. Carrenda suddenly.
"Don't you remember those people&mdash;the Eeglines,
or Eigleens&mdash;that came over to the hill
near Mount Varcrobis where we lived before we
came here? who wanted to know if we had seen a
strange little girl, dressed all in ferns? She is the
Eigleens' lost little girl."
</p><p class="calibre13">Mrs. Carrenda looked puzzled. 
</p><p class="calibre13">"They told us, you know, that they had given <span><span id="calibre_link-103" data-page-number="88" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/96" data-page-index="96" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/96"></span></span>up all hope of having Ee&mdash;ee&mdash;serpip" (Toby
started violently) "back again&mdash;"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh yes, I remember now."
</p><p class="calibre13">"&mdash;When Fleuriss came, and&mdash;"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh yes, it all comes back to me now. They
were making a great effort to find her and entice
her bark home by telling her about her baby
sister."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Why, father," said Toby," Eepersip&mdash;"He
suddenly saw her in his mind, kneeling in front of
him, begging him not to tell&mdash;and he said no
more. Nobody noticed his remark.
</p><p class="calibre13">A moment Mrs. Carrenda gazed at her husband
astounded. Then she said: "I believe it is so. Let
us send word to them right off."
</p><p class="calibre13">"No," said Mr. Carrenda, bluntly. "Supposing
they came all the way down here. Supposing
the plan failed. Mrs. Eigleen would only be unhappier
than ever. We'll just have to let them
alone for a while. Supposing <i class="calibre10">we</i> try it. Supposing
it fails. Mrs. Eigleen will never know. Supposing
it succeeds. They will be <i class="calibre10">much</i> happier, and we
shall have made some staunch and grateful
friends."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, let's try it!" agreed Mrs. Carrenda.
</p><p class="calibre13">"I bet Eepersip&mdash;Ee-serpip, Eeserpip,  <span><span id="calibre_link-104" data-page-number="89" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/97" data-page-index="97" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/97"></span></span>Eepersip, Eeserpip, Eepersip &mdash; funny name I &mdash; I bet she'll go home fast when she finds out."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Perhaps&mdash;but she is like a sea-nymph now.
How strange it is! Well, it's worth trying, at any
rate."
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip had listened with growing amazement&mdash;fascinated,
entranced. But when they paused in
their conversation, the charm was broken that had
held her there. She sped away into the woods. She
came to a place that she knew well, a glade surrounded
by ferns and a few wild-rose-bushes now
in bloom.
</p><p class="calibre13">She had a little sister!&mdash;it was too much. And
that little sister haunted her dreams and her imagination,
making everything seem less joyful than
before. She felt a strange longing&mdash;the longing
to see her. She might he several years old now.
Eepersip had forgotten what a "year" meant, but
she had a vague feeling that Fleuriss had been
living some time already. Why had no one told
her? She felt a sort of angry resentment, but it
cooled immediately when she remembered that her
parents <i class="calibre10">had</i> been trying desperately to tell her.
Yes, a plan was certainly shaping itself in Eepersip's
mind&mdash;but not the plan of letting herself be
caught, tamed, and carried home. No indeed. She
dreamed of some day going home by stealth, <span><span id="calibre_link-105" data-page-number="90" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/98" data-page-index="98" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/98"></span></span>seeing Fleuriss, and playing with her as she now
played with Toby. She wondered silently if she
would be anything like the fair-haired little boy.
She wondered whether Fleuriss, too, would play
with her secretly. If Fleuriss were like Toby, how
wonderful it would be!
</p><p class="calibre13">But the problem of getting back home to see her
did not appear so serious to her now while she had
Toby to play with.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">She continued her beloved explorations, discovering
islands, beaches, peninsulas, and rocks
out of sight of land, which she charted down in her
mind, so that she could almost always find them.
</p><p class="calibre13">One day Toby came to her and told her that
they were going off on a tramp, rowing over across
the bay to the woods near a little cottage that Mr.
Carrenda knew about. They had always been interested
in the cottage; they wanted to see who
was living there. And they had heard about some
beautiful hills behind it, which Mr. Carrenda
wanted very much to see. And if it was pleasant
they were going to start the next day. Eepersip was
curious. She wondered if it could possible be <i class="calibre10">her</i>
cottage and <i class="calibre10">her</i> hills&mdash;the cottage she had  <span><span id="calibre_link-106" data-page-number="91" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/99" data-page-index="99" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/99"></span></span>discovered, and the hills that she had climbed about
in. She decided to follow and see where it was that
the Carrendas were going.
</p><p class="calibre13">When the boat started she let it get some way
off, then she plunged into the sea and followed it.
The waves came up behind, and she gained fast,
but when she got dangerously near she stopped
for a while, waiting for the boat to get farther off.
They landed just where she thought they might&mdash;by
the little cottage.
</p><p class="calibre13">Near it they set up their tent, and soon they
were exploring the peninsula. They climbed the
beautiful hill which Eepersip had climbed. Once
they saw her as she darted behind a tree, and wondered
how she had got there so quickly. And they
fell to talking about her again. She heard them
talking over their plan of capturing her, telling her
about Fleuriss, and, when she had been smoothed
down a bit, letting her go back to the Eigleens to
make them happy. If only they could have foreseen!
</p><p class="calibre13">They tried only once, and never had the chance
again. It was a golden day in October. Eepersip
was sitting on a rock repairing some tears in her
sea-weed dress. The waves were high, and every
once in a while a little spray would splash up on to
the rock where she was sitting. Mr. Carrenda  <span><span id="calibre_link-107" data-page-number="92" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/100" data-page-index="100" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/100"></span></span>discovered her sitting there, and, tiptoeing forward
he caught her by the shoulders. She gnashed her
little white teeth at him and struggled to get away,
but he held her fast, and was about to pick her up
in his arms. She shouted: "O waves, help me!"
And, magically, a great wave rushed up, whirled itself
into the air, and broke in Mr. Carrenda's face.
He dropped her, and with a lightning manœuvre
she dived down from the rock into the sea,
and was far out before he recovered from the surprise.
After this she remained far from the cottage
and made her home on a deserted island.
This island was a lovely place. It had a beach of
fine sand on one side and was entirely surrounded
with rocks on the other sides&mdash;rocks and, in
places, even high cliffs. There was a grove of yellow
pines there, where Eepersip danced when she
wished to turn nymph again. There was a spring of
fresh water on a small hill behind the grove. The
hill was still covered with blueberries and raspberries;
also there was a multitude of the plants
with the sweet white roots that Eepersip was so
fond of. There were asters, too, and Eepersip
wove them in with her ferns or sea-weed, and
crowned herself with them. Very happy to find not
a single house on the island, she lived there for a
long time, glad also to be able to have both the sea <span><span id="calibre_link-108" data-page-number="93" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/101" data-page-index="101" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/101"></span></span>and the woods, to which she still instinctively returned
occasionally. The period through which she
stayed on this uninhabited island was one of the
happiest stretches of her life by the sea.
</p><p class="calibre13">But, now that she was alone again, Eepersip was
filled once more with longing to see the little sister&mdash;to
know her, love her, play with her, teach her
to leap and dance and swim: filled with curiosities
about what was going on at the home which she
had been away from for so long. And these emotions
grew and grew until they became a firm resolution.
She struggled a while to prevent herself
from thinking she had made a mistake in running
away, and, thinking it all over, said that she had
not, even if she did miss such exciting things as
little sisters.
</p><p class="calibre13">The plan of seeing Fleuriss had become more
and more developed. now that she saw little of the
boy and had more time to think about it (It was
only once in a while that she swam to the mainland
to play with him.) Her idea had changed a great
deal: it now was to take Fleuriss away to live with
her. She wondered whether she could ever get her
over those awful crags, through that shadowy forest,
to the sea whether she could make her comfortable
living the wild He. Here was a difficult
situation, for Eepersip was sure that so young a <span><span id="calibre_link-109" data-page-number="94" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/102" data-page-index="102" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/102"></span></span>child could never endure the hardships of the life
she lived&mdash;at least, until she was used to it.
</p><p class="calibre13">This problem troubled her mind for days. Then,
suddenly, as she was gazing over the restless
murmuring sea, she had a great inspiration, "Oh!
beautiful!" she exclaimed in her delight. The
vision of the little brown cottage in the grove of
white pines had come back to her&mdash;the whole
thing, how she had been borne to it on her raft by
those friendly yet terrible waves. And now she had
a use for it! It seemed strange, when she hated
houses so. But then, no one need know. She would
go at once and make sure whether the Carrendas
had gone from their camp, then fix up the cottage
and discover all its secrets. <i class="calibre10">Then</i> she could go and
take Fleuriss away.
</p><p class="calibre13">So one cold day she swam back to the cottage.
The Carrendas' tent was gone; everything was as
it had been before. But this time it did not appear
hateful. She opened the door and went into
pleasant little living-room with the fireplace. Then
she investigated the whole house shore thoroughly. She
found a room with glass cupboards on the walls,
filled with a marvellous collection of all kinds of
sea-weeds, shells, and corals (how Fleuriss would
enjoy them! she thought); and there was a tiny
kitchen, There was one small attic room, with a <span><span id="calibre_link-110" data-page-number="95" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/103" data-page-index="103" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/103"></span></span>ladder going up to it through a trap-door, and in
it was a soft little bed with warm blankets, and a
fireplace. Above the bed were three casement
windows, and Eepersip liked to think how it would
delight Fleuriss to see the stars out these. When
she went to the second floor she came to a snug
alcove with glass doors opening on to a porch, free
to the wind and sun, overlooking the sea: and two
sunny bedrooms.
</p><p class="calibre13">But just as she was preparing to start after
Fleuriss, her reason again detained her. Fleuriss
of course could not begin her wild life in the winter:
she must have a summer of it first, to sec what
it was like. So Eepersip waited patiently till spring.
During the winter she lived in a great pasture on
a hill behind the cottage.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">The spring came round incredibly soon, and
again Eepersip prepared to start.
</p><p class="calibre13">The night before she went a great black cloud
came up from the west, and soon a gale was raging.
The waves mounted higher than any Eepersip
had ever seen before, topped with flying snow-white
spray. They leaped the highest cliffs, thundered
on the wet rocks, and then retreated,  <span><span id="calibre_link-111" data-page-number="96" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/104" data-page-index="104" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/104"></span></span>awashing down through the cracks with a strange hollow
sound and sweeping the sea-weeds wildly up and
down. The wind sounded as on a mountain-top, a
curious mixture of high-pitched whistling and bass
droning. Occasionally it would rise into a terrific
scream, making the waves rage with the uncanny
storm-green. At the crisis of the storm Eepersip,
who had been standing on the beach watching, her
curls flying, her ferns fluttering and often tearing
loose, flung herself into the storm from a high
rock, and was swept about like a tiny insect, disappearing
under a wave, bobbing up to take a
breath just as the next breaker washed over her.
She had a glorious time out in the waves and the
spray. The sea-gulls shrieked; sometimes they
struck at a fish, and appeared all covered with
spray and shaking the drops from their wings&mdash;strong
narrow wings that beat down the air as the
birds rose again, to hover and swoop and plunge.
These marvellous birds being blown wildly in the
gale reminded Eepersip of the swallows, as they
were tossed about by the high pasture winds&mdash;the
swallows she had loved so when she lived on the
meadow.
</p><p class="calibre13">Slowly the wind abated its fury, and Eepersip,
covered with water-drops and spray like a silver
fish or a sea-gull, swam to the shore bubbling with <span><span id="calibre_link-112" data-page-number="97" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/105" data-page-index="105" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/105"></span></span>happiness ,With the stater still standing on her
hair, she sand a sea-song on the beach, accompanied
by the rocking waves, now calmed down,
and by screaming and wildly circling gulls.
</p><p class="calibre13">It was a wonderful night afterwards, for soon
the sea was entirely calm, and the moon and the
stars came out, reflecting themselves in trembling
silver. Eepersip was up all that night, dancing
singing, swimming and diving in the glorious
moonlight. And then she remembered&mdash;to-morrow!
and went up on the hill to say good-bye to
the meadow, the pastured hill, and quiet, mossy
pool that she had loved so.
</p><p class="calibre13">Up on the hill she saw the sun rise. First the
dark blue sky turned grey, and then a pearly streak
came on the horizon as the first ray of the sun appeared;
then it turned to the most heavenly shad
of pink and deep rose, and then into the blue of
one of the most gorgeous days Eepersip had ever
seen. She gazed and gazed at the dawn until it
grew pale and buttercup yellow, and finally turned
to blue. The sun made a mass of gold sun-sparkles
on the sea, and they blended together from the
high hill and formed a solid splotch of gold, separating
at the edges into individual sparkles. It was
a windy day, but the wind was warm, and at first
the sea was only rippling gently and smiling.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-113" data-page-number="98" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/106" data-page-index="106" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/106"></span></span>Then Eepersip remembered her little sister
Fleuriss, and she wished her already there to share
that beautiful, beautiful day. And off at one end of
the beach she found, to her delight, a little green
boat with two oars, which had been washed in by
the storm. Now she had everything she needed, for
the clumsy raft was difficult to manage in the wind,
and she might even be blown so far off that she
could never find the cottage again Now, however,
all was ready.
</p><p class="calibre13">And so she made her way home, beginning in
the boat, and rowing to where she had first entered
the sea; then past the great precipices over which
she had so laboriously clambered as she went to
the sea. over hills, down into valleys, crossing
rivers, and tearing her way through forests, until
at last, to her delight, she arrived at the beautiful
meadow where she had spent her first years of
wildness with Chippy, Snowflake and the deer.
</p><p class="calibre13">The deer did not remember Eepersip; that was
one thing which distressed her. But a little fawn
came cautiously and sniffed at her, obviously wishing
he dared to approach and ear the ferns of her
dress. She did not see Chippy anywhere.
</p><p class="calibre13">She was soon at her own house, spying around,
and looking in windows. All she could think of was
Fleuriss, her little sister.

<p class="calibre13">would be so easy to take Fleuriss away. She
jight consent to play, like Toby; but to run away,
ike Eepersip?&mdash;it was a great problem. Eepersip
et use some other means than simply appearing
and asking her sister to go with her. Perhaps she
would entice her on with the assurance that there
was something wonderful waiting. Or maybe she
id show Fleuriss wonder after wonder&mdash;point
e beautiful sea from far away, then lead her
the little cottage which she had prepared.
And if Fleuriss was cold, or hungry, what should
do then? Perhaps she would not like roots to
eat. Then, suddenly, an idea: she would dress herself
up in wonderful flowers interwoven with the
ferns, she would lure butterflies about her wreaths,
she would bear armfuls of roses and apple-blossoms
and lilacs and scatter them over Fleuriss, she
would make her a fern dress, and, thus fascinating
her, draw her away.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip wondered where she could sleep, near
the house, and yet concealed. She thought of returning
to the meadow, but that would be too far
for convenient communication with Fleuriss. And <span><span id="calibre_link-116" data-page-number="101" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/109" data-page-index="109" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/109"></span></span>then she saw a lilac-bush on the eastern side of the
cottage&mdash;a great tall lilac-bush, thick and with
great branches. It looked as though she could go
into it. And when she tried, she found, to her great
delight, that she could squeeze in, curl up in comfort,
and be absolutely invisible from the outside.
</p><p class="calibre13">Then she began to make her fairy array, weaving
more ferns into her skirt, and more and more,
until it was thick and flouncy&mdash;maiden-hair ferns
and Christmas ferns, evergreen ferns and hay-scented
ferns. She tucked flowers all over her dress&mdash;late
daffodils, cosmos, wild geraniums, primroses.
She made a girdle of yellow daisies, a crown
of golden buttercups; she plucked a bunch of roses,
lilacs, and ferns, binding them with daisies woven
together. A great bouquet of violets decorated her
dress&mdash;violets and little white Pyrolas. With a
huge hollyhock for her wand and her arms full of
lilacs and roses, she danced in the woods, thinking
how her little sister would wonder&mdash;and follow.
</p><p class="calibre13">That evening early she climbed an oak which
was beside the window of her former room, and
peeped in. The moonlight shone on the face of a
child lying in a little wooden crib. She had fluffy
black curls and bright, snapping black eyes, and she
was watching delightedly the shadows of the
branches on her wall and softly humming.

want her, I want her!" Entranced, Eepersip
watched, sitting in a crotch just outside the window&mdash;watched
her as she lay there, tracing with her
finger the curving patterns on her wall-paper; as
she played her hands in the moonlight and the
waving shadows on her wall. And after a while the
humming died away, the finger ceased to stroke the
wall, her eyes closed, and in a moment she was
gently sleeping. Before Eepersip went down she
left a fair sprig of apple-blossoms on Fleuriss's
bed&mdash;apple-blossoms that, with difficulty, she had
brought up the tree. When she went back to her
lilac-bush she imagined Fleuriss's surprise, when
she should wake, to see them on her bed; imagined
Fleuriss following her, all fascinated by butterflies
and sweet flowers; imagined her little sister climbing
mountains with her, eating berries and roots,
swimming and diving and dancing; and&mdash;Her
thoughts began to grow more and more fantastic
&mdash;the smell of lilacs intoxicated her&mdash;and she
went to sleep.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">In the morning she climbed the tree again.
Fleuriss was just waking. Her eyes were turned <span><span id="calibre_link-118" data-page-number="103" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/111" data-page-index="111" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/111"></span></span>toward the lovely oak-tree, watching the sunlight
playing on the emerald leaves. She caught a
glimpse of Eepersip as she vanished around the
trunk.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, Mother," she called softly. "I saw a
nymph! She smiled at me, and went away."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Hush, child," said Mrs. Eigleen, coming
upstairs and stroking gently the silky black hair.
"You were only dreaming."
</p><p class="calibre13">"No, Mother," returned the child, "I was
awake. I <i class="calibre10">saw</i> a nymph, really."
</p><p class="calibre13">Mrs. Eigleen only smiled.
</p><p class="calibre13">And then Fleuriss saw the flowers. "O Mother,"
she cried, " did you bring those to me?" Mrs. Eigleen
was wonderstruck.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Why, no!" she answered.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Maybe that nymph left them here."
</p><p class="calibre13">Mrs. Eigleen was astounded enough not to contradict
her. "Perhaps," she said.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip descended again and ran off to her safe
hiding-place in the lilac-bush. "She is so, so
lovely!" she thought. "I want her more and
more."
</p><p class="calibre13">In a short time little Fleuriss appeared with
Mrs. Eigleen. "Fleuriss," said her mother, "you
may play here in the garden, but don't go outside
it, and don't climb the trees."
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-119" data-page-number="104" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/112" data-page-index="112" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/112"></span></span>"All right, Mother."
</p><p class="calibre13">"And don't run off and worry me as you did
once before." She had <i class="calibre10">not</i> forgotten Eepersip.
Perhaps she scented something in the
air. Those flowers troubled her.
</p><p class="calibre13">"No, I won't."
</p><p class="calibre13">Mrs. Eigleen went in, and Fleuriss began to run
about and play. Then Eepersip stepped out from
under the bush, and the lovely butterflies, lured by
her flowers, fluttered and hovered around her.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh," said Fleuriss," goodness, how you
frightened me. Sit down on the grass, and talk
with me. And <i class="calibre10">how</i> do you get those butterflies?
They always fly away from me."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Listen, Fleuriss," said Eepersip. "I am
Eepersip, who ran away. The butterflies and birds
all love me and come to me in great Hocks when I
call them. And I want you. I want to take you with
me to live wild, and eat leaves and berries with the
birds&mdash;sweet red berries. And if you come the
butterflies will gather around you, too. They will
not any other way. And look at all my flowers!
Butterflies love my flowers."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, did <i class="calibre10">you</i> bring me those <i class="calibre10">bee-yoo-ti-ful</i>
flowers?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes, I did. Come&nbsp;!"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh," answered Fleuriss, "and wouldn't it be <span><span id="calibre_link-120" data-page-number="105" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/113" data-page-index="113" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/113"></span></span>funny if Mother came out and found me not
here!"
</p><p class="calibre13">"And think&mdash;the birds, the butterflies, the
flowers! Look, I'd dress you like this, with ferns
and flowers and butterflies. And what fun we could
have! We would dance and sing and chase each
other amongst the fluttering leaves."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oo, I could never catch you."
</p><p class="calibre13">"No, but I could catch you, and that would be
as much fun."
</p><p class="calibre13">"But Mother doesn't like me to eat leaves, and
berries all the time make one sick."
</p><p class="calibre13">"But we would not have berries all the time.
We would dig up sweet white roots and wash them
clean; and <i class="calibre10">m-m!</i> they are good, little sister Fleuriss.
We would have honey. The bees gather honey
from the flowers, which they would share with us."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Bees sting," said Fleuriss, shrinking away;
"they sting, and they hurt, Eepersip."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, but the bees love us all so they don't sting
us," answered Eepersip. "It's only the people that
try to hurt them that they sting. We wouldn't hurt
them."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, <i class="calibre10">Eepersip!</i> the leaves and butterflies, and&mdash;and
honey&mdash;<i class="calibre10">m-m!</i> But I oughtn't, really," she
said, backing off toward the house.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, come," said Eepersip, "come, don't go <span><span id="calibre_link-121" data-page-number="106" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/114" data-page-index="114" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/114"></span></span>away. Your Mother wouldn't care; she would love
to see how happy you were. <i class="calibre10">Please</i> come." And
Eepersip's hands went out in supplication, scattering
over Fleuriss wreaths of flowers, sprays of
berries, crimson, gold, frosty white.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh how beautiful!" exclaimed the little girl.
But when she looked up, Eepersip had vanished.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">Suddenly the door opened and Mrs. Eigleen
stepped out. Eepersip had darted under the
welcome branches of an apple-tree, whose thick blossoms
kept her from sight.
</p><p class="calibre13">"How sweet it smells!" said Mrs. Eigleen&mdash;
"just as if a fairy had been here. Where did those
flowers come from, Fleuriss?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh," answered Fleuriss, "I saw the most
beautiful girl. She brought me flowers and called
me 'little <i class="calibre10">sister'</i> and wanted me to go away with her!"
</p><p class="calibre13">Pale and weak from fright, Mrs. Eigleen took
Fleuriss by the hand and dragged her roughly into
the house.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip sat down under the apple-tree in ecstasy.
"I saw her," she said softly, "I saw her and
talked to her, and&mdash;oh, how dear she is&nbsp;! But I <span><span id="calibre_link-122" data-page-number="107" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/115" data-page-index="115" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/115"></span></span><i class="calibre10">do</i> wish she hadn't told about me." She waited
there, and in a short time Fleuriss appeared again,
running.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Eepersip, Eepersip," she cried, "where are
you?"
</p><p class="calibre13">In a moment Eepersip had her arms around her
waist, kissing her and hugging her.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Are you coming?" she asked; "have you decided
to come, Fleuriss?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Y-y-es," said Fleuriss, "I really have, Eepersip.
I thought all dinner time, and couldn't eat, I
was so 'xcited! But we must go quickly now, or
they will run after us."
</p><p class="calibre13">So they ran quickly into the woods&mdash;ran amid
the trees and flowers until they were far from the
house. Eepersip showed her little sister how to
dance, and they danced together. She also showed
her how to leap and run fast, and Fleuriss was delighted.
When they grew tired, they sat down together
and made fern dresses and flower wreaths.
Fleuriss followed Eepersip's example, casting
aside her dress, shoes, and stockings.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, how 'licious the grass feels on my bare
toes!" she said, "and the soft moss. Eepersip, I
feel just like a nymph." (A slight pause.) "When
I saw the flowers I said: 'Mother, I think a <i class="calibre10">nymph</i>
left them there,' and she said: 'Oh, no, there <span><span id="calibre_link-123" data-page-number="108" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/116" data-page-index="116" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/116"></span></span>aren't any nymphs. You're only dreaming!' <i class="calibre10">Are</i>
there nymphs, Eepersip?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, yes, Fleuriss, and if we dance and run and
dress just like them, we'll pretend <i class="calibre10">we're</i> nymphs,
too."
</p><p class="calibre13">"But why can't we <i class="calibre10">see</i> them, Eepersip?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, we can, if we took very hard. They're all
around in the trees, the flowers, and the woods.
<i class="calibre10">Sometimes</i> we can't see them, and they turn into
butterflies so we can. I can see them."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Well, sometimes," said Fleuriss thoughtfully,
"it seems as if they were everywhere&mdash;when it's
windy, you know, and sunny, and there are shadows.
In my garden it's so beautiful I think there
must be nymphs. I can <i class="calibre10">feel</i> them, not exactly see."
</p><p class="calibre13">There was a pause.
</p><p class="calibre13">Then&mdash;"Where we going now, Eepersip?"
for Eepersip was gradually working off to a hill
which was a peak of Mount Varcrobis, north of
Eiki-ennern Peak.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Fleuriss," said Eepersip, with a strange emotion
in her voice," have you ever seen the sea?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"No, but I heard Mother talking about it once.
She said maybe you had gone down there; and she
told me it was lots of blue water, and there were
boats there. Did you really go there?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes; it's <i class="calibre10">so</i> beautiful, Fleuriss. The sun makes <span><span id="calibre_link-124" data-page-number="109" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/117" data-page-index="117" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/117"></span></span>the waves sparkle like gold, and the great white
gulls with their long, narrow wings go gliding,
circling over the water, sometimes plunging down
and catching fish underneath. And there is white
sand there, soft sand, and shells and pretty pebbles,
and little fishes swimming. And when its windy
the waves come dashing up on the rocks, flinging
spray high in the air. And there is sea-weed, too,
Fleuriss, green sea-weed that goes floating up and
down as the waves stir it. And corals, too. Oh, my
little sister, it's so, so beautiful. I would show you
how to leap into it from the rocks, and how to
swim&mdash;to be a mermaid and play with the gulls
and the fishes, dressed all in sea-weeds!"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, Eepersip I let's go <i class="calibre10">now!</i>"
</p><p class="calibre13">"And I have a little cottage down there for you
to live in&mdash;a pretty little cottage just like your
home."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, how nice!"
</p><p class="calibre13">"And we shall go riding up and down on the
great waves, Fleuriss, while the sea-gulls scream
over our heads. We shall go 'way out of sight of
land and find islands and rocks out there. And the
waves are tremendous when it's windy&mdash;very
windy."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oo&mdash;"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Fleuriss!" And Eepersip caught her little  <span><span id="calibre_link-125" data-page-number="110" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/118" data-page-index="118" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/118"></span></span>sister in her arms&mdash;glad that she had succeeded in
entrancing her with the sea.
</p><p class="calibre13">"But, Eepersip," said Fleuriss, doubtfully,
"where <i class="calibre10">are</i> we going now?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I thought, Fleuriss, that we'd go to that great
hill over there&mdash;do you see?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Go over there so that you can see from 'way
of how beautiful it is."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh yes; I'm crazy to see it!"
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip saw that this hill was wooded on one
side, but on the far side it was like a pasture&mdash;side,
she could see sunlight glinting on it. On they went,
often stopping to pick flowers, to dig up roots, or
to refresh themselves at some little tinkling brook
or mossy spring. Once as they were pushing
through a fence of low beech-branches they came
to a spring all surrounded with green moss&mdash;oh!
so soft. There were ferns nodding beside it, and
one or two strange pink orchids gazed at themselves
admiringly in its surface. At the bottom
were white stones. A cool, green frog plopped into
it as they arrived. And Fleuriss was fascinated.
She sat there for a long time, watching him reappear
for air, then bob down again when he saw
that they were still watching him.
</p><p class="calibre13">Again they came into a great meadow dotted <span><span id="calibre_link-126" data-page-number="111" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/119" data-page-index="119" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/119"></span></span>with flowers. Butterflies with soft wings stroked
Eepersip's cheeks caressingly. Fleuriss danced
through the flowers, looking, as Eepersip thought,
like a little butterfly herself. The sky was a heavenly
deep blue&mdash;a rich deep blue, yet filled and
sparkling with all the gold of the sun and all the
coolth of snow. She could see for miles into it, as
if it had suddenly come nearer than usual. She
reached up and could almost see her fingers touching
it. What a strange sensation!
</p><p class="calibre13">But Fleuriss had a stranger one. As Eepersip
danced along, it seemed as though her feet barely
touched the ground. The flowers and grasses
swayed gently beneath her, but they were not
crushed. And Fleuriss felt a bit of dread coming
into her mind&mdash;dread of living and staying with
this strange sister. What if she should grow tired
of Fleuriss and run off? Suppose she should change
into a tree&mdash;a leaf&mdash;a sprite? But Fleuriss
fought with this feeling&mdash;because she wanted to
live by the ocean, and to do the things that Eepersip
had promised.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">After a while they came to the foot of the great
hill. They slept down there, near a tiny lakelet, in <span><span id="calibre_link-127" data-page-number="112" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/120" data-page-index="120" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/120"></span></span>the soft grass and among the flowers, with the
tinkle, tinkle of a little brook in their ears all night.
The next morning they climbed the hill together,
and it was very steep and rocky. Fleuriss had to be
helped often, and grew tired before she reached
the top. But Eepersip lured her on by the promise
of seeing the ocean, and they struggled painfully
up.
</p><p class="calibre13">The sea stretched away to the horizon, blue and
sparkling as it met the sky. Fleuriss was spellbound. 
</p><p class="calibre13">"Eepersip, is that the sea?" she asked.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes, Fleuriss&mdash;the sea, the sea!"
</p><p class="calibre13">Off to the north was a range of high blue-green
hills, and off beyond them higher ones, and higher&mdash;billowing
mountains&mdash;and beyond them was a
range of snowy peaks, rising, sharply outlined, into
the blue. The lakelet where they had slept was like
an opal set with dark green pines. But those mountains&mdash;!
never before had Eepersip seen anything
like them. The sea was not nearly so beautiful.
And again she felt that longing which she had
felt when she saw the sea&mdash;but a more passionate
longing.
</p><p class="calibre13">And Fleuriss? How could she climb those great
peaks&mdash;she, who had had great difficulty even
with the little hill? Well, Fleuriss could grow more <span><span id="calibre_link-128" data-page-number="113" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/121" data-page-index="121" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/121"></span></span>used to such things, and then they would go together.
But Fleuriss&mdash;Fleuriss barefoot, dressed
in ferns&mdash;on those snowy summits! No, it would
be impossible for years and years. She would have
to wait&mdash;or else go alone.
</p><p class="calibre13">But the hill had other things than just the view.
For there were the loveliest little winding lanes,
and bright open places, and close spots where they
could hardly push through the bushes; great
patches of delicious soft grass, then again enormous
smooth-topped rocks from where they had
first found the long-sought vision of the sea. Such
feasts as Nature laid before them! There were
great beds of the most delicious wild strawberries,
and nobody to sham them with but the birds. And
they and the birds gobbled them; and it seemed as
if the more they ate the more there were to eat;
they ripened all the time. And in this marvellous
place there were such contrasts! They could have
anything they wanted there. There were places
where the sun always struck brilliantly, and cool,
shady ones for the hot days&mdash;places where not
much sun ever came. There was the loveliest of
soft grass, and then again nothing but brambles
and heaps of pointed rocks. There were lanes leading
through the woods occasionally, and there
were places where no one would ever suspect that <span><span id="calibre_link-129" data-page-number="114" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/122" data-page-index="122" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/122"></span></span>there was any such thing as a lane. There were
little fairy glades where they could dance together&mdash;glades
bordered with ferns and carpeted with
moss.
</p><p class="calibre13">Fleuriss and Eepersip lived there enchanted day
Fleuriss and  after day, and although they often saw the sea,
they did not wish to leave the hill. Fleuriss spoke
about several times, but Eepersip would hurriedly
change the subject. That range of blue hills
seemed to be calling her&mdash;she would forget the
sea for a while, until the next year. After they had
stayed where they were for some time, they would
go on and on to the blue hills, and perhaps explore
the great snowy mountains beyond. She could manage
with Fleuriss somehow.
</p><p class="calibre13">One day they went exploring farther than ever
toward the east. They followed a narrow path,
winding, winding through the bushes. And then it
curved around toward the north-east and led
through low laurel-trees, and here Eepersip
stopped to make for Fleuriss a crown of the blossoms.
And again the path turned and came on to a
broader gravel road all bordered with gorgeous
roses of red and white, and Fleuriss was very much
surprised at their magnificent beauty. But Eepersip
was distressed. So they had come to a place
where there were roads, houses, and people! But <span><span id="calibre_link-130" data-page-number="115" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/123" data-page-index="123" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/123"></span></span>there was any such thing as a lane.

Eepersip hoped that
there would be none, for she was as entranced as
Fleuriss with the beauty of it all. And then they
switched off on another little path, leading southeast
on to a wide lawn all bordered with marvellous
roses. Here they danced together a long time.
Next they turned into another gravelled path
which led eastward, through clumps of roses and
laurel, downhill and uphill, for a long way; and
then they saw a garden brilliant with colour.
Fleuriss was dazed, there were so many flowering
bushes&mdash;rhododendron, laurel, honeysuckle,
azalea, quince, and fire-blossom. Hummingbirds,
bright emerald and ruby with moonlight wings,
were darting and sparkling about, sipping honey,
resting and quivering on the air.
</p><p class="calibre13">But soon after they had discovered the garden,
Eepersip said that she was going on a short journey,
coming back in two or three days. "Will you
be all right here alone, little sister?" she said
anxiously.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh yes, Eepersip, and I'm going to find lots of
things to show you when you come back. But where
are you going?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I'm going&mdash;going&mdash;to a beautiful place&mdash;and
take you there sometime."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh&mdash;I see. Can't I go now?"
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-132" data-page-number="117" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/125" data-page-index="125" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/125"></span></span>
"No&mdash;because&mdash;it would be too hard now.
Wait till I go and find the easiest way for you."
</p><p class="calibre13">"All right&mdash;good-bye!"
</p><p class="calibre13">And, with a rustle of ferns, Eepersip vanished
around a great rhododendron-bush.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">Fleuriss continued her explorations alone. She
saw a gorgeous butterfly come sailing toward her,
of yellow streaked with black. Others followed,
and they covered her with soft wing-caresses,
crowning her head with their wings. Fleuriss
thought (as Eepersip had told her) that they were
the fairies turning themselves into butterflies so
that she could see them.
</p><p class="calibre13">Not a mouse stirred when she wormed her way
through the bushes, taking care not to step on
leaves or dry twigs so as to make a noise. And then
the sun started to set and turned the whole sky
golden and rose. Fleuriss crept in among a vine
with golden flowers (there was no rich purple fruit
yet, only the lovely flowers) and watched. And, lo!
each leaf was quivering, and on their smooth surfaces
was represented another miniature sunset.
How marvellous the rose and gold looked through
the mass of trembling green leaves 
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-133" data-page-number="118" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/126" data-page-index="126" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/126"></span></span>
Then Fleuriss squeezed her way out of the bush
and began to explore again. Pushing northward in
the dim, rosy light, she came to a smooth lawn of
pale green moss. On the other side was a stretch
of woods, then another lawn, of grass this time
and smaller; and then there was a great row of
massive pines and beyond them an opaline lake.
And still the sun went down, and the mass of
colour became smaller and brighter, and Fleuriss,
who had never seen so much beauty in her little
life, gazed and gazed. The colour faded slowly,
slowly, as she watched, until only a deep flush was
left, and it was then that Fleuriss thought she was
in the heart of a giant rose. And&mdash;inconceivable&mdash;she
looked, and she was. She was sure of it. She
could even see the great curling petals around her.
Right at the sun was a burning spot. That was the
pollen of the great flower. And this tiny fire burned
and burned until only one bright red spark was
left. Then it too went out, and after it all the rose
colour faded away.
</p><p class="calibre13">Then Fleuriss turned to the lake, which also had
held in its bright blue surface an image of the sunset.
The sky was deep blue now. The pines looked
even darker against it, and in the lake Fleuriss
could see the reflection of the crescent moon setting.
And then she ran down by the side of the lake, <span><span id="calibre_link-134" data-page-number="119" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/127" data-page-index="127" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/127"></span></span>and very dark and strange it looked in the evening.
Dipping her little hands into the clear, crystal
water, she drank, for she was thirsty. But she was
too tired to appreciate any more beauty just then,
and so she crept back to her little nest of flowers
to go to sleep. Then she heard a gurgle of sweet
silvery music, and she listened spellbound, entranced.
But it was no wicked witch, seeking to
entice her by spells: it was the solitary wood-thrush,
that superb singer of the dusk. And then 
Fleuriss dropped off to sleep.
</p><p class="calibre13">The next morning dawned fair, and she rose
bewitched with what she had been through. The
sunset and the silvery notes of the thrush all came
back to her. She went down by the lake. It was
very different now. Its blue was sparkling with the
rays of the sun, whereas before it had looked very
solitary&mdash;an icy cold blue. There was no beach&mdash;just
a grassy bank&mdash;and in the shallow water she
saw some little silvery fishes swimming and playing
in shoals. And she watched them in their happy
play for a long time, fascinated by the way they
raced after each other around the shining stones
and pebbles. Because they were no bright and
gleaming, poor little Fleuriss thought that they
were some rare and unheard-of fish, little dreaming
that they were just common minnows.

<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-135" data-page-number="120" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/128" data-page-index="128" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/128"></span></span>
Eepersip came back that day in a strange way.
Fleuriss was looking down on the meadowy side of
the hill, where the long green grass waved in the
wind and butterflies were fluttering. And us she
looked, suddenly&mdash;there was Eepersip standing
in front of her. She had come from nowhere&mdash;she
was just there without coming at all. Fleuriss
was appalled. She remembered that strange dancing&mdash;was
her sister about to melt into the air?
Fleuriss stood stock-still.
</p><p class="calibre13">Finally she raised her head and said, at first
faintly, but with growing enthusiasm: "Oh,
Eepersip, last night there was a great rose, and I
was inside it&mdash;and I found a beautiful lake with
fishes in it&mdash;oh, wonderful fishes of silver&mdash;and
the beautiful birdie sang me to sleep in the flowers."
And then, her voice sounding strangely
timid: "O Eepersip&mdash;I want&mdash;Mother&mdash;to
see it&mdash;so beautiful. I love&mdash;it here, but&mdash;&mdash;I
know Mother would like to see it, too. And I guess I can't
get along without her. I guess I can't,
Eepersip."
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip was broken-hearted. "But, Fleuriss,"
she said&mdash;and Fleuriss shuddered a very little as
Eepersip took her hand&mdash;"Fleuriss if your
mother came, she would take you back home, and
you would not be here any more. If she would <span><span id="calibre_link-136" data-page-number="121" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/129" data-page-index="129" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/129"></span></span>come to see it, all right, but she would not&mdash;and
so you would not see it either. Come on, show me
the lake you found."
</p><p class="calibre13">Fleuriss was happy in a flash. Laughing and
dancing, she took her sister down to the lake and
showed her the wondrous fishes. They went in
bathing together, and Eepersip showed Fleuriss
how to swim, as she had shown Toby. Fleuriss
was wild with joy. Then they splashed each other
and played tag in the water. Eepersip puzzled
Fleuriss by swimming under water, and Fleuriss
would scream with delight when she came up in a
totally unexpected place. This new pastime kept
them happy for several days.
</p><p class="calibre13">But again Fleuriss began to grow miserable&mdash;and
homesick.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">And again Eepersip resisted this feeling for a
long time&mdash;two or three weeks of misery. But at
the end of that time she began to think.
</p><p class="calibre13">To begin with, she thought about where she had
been on that little expedition of hers. She had been
up toward those blue hills to see from nearer the
snowy mountains. She had loved them more and
wanted more than ever to go to them. She asked <span><span id="calibre_link-137" data-page-number="122" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/130" data-page-index="130" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/130"></span></span>Fleuriss if she would not like to climb the high
peaks with her. But Fleuriss replied, almost snappishly:
"You know what I want, Eepersip."
</p><p class="calibre13">Of course this misery weighed down Eepersip's
mind frightfully; she was very uncomfortable.
And then she began to think that after all she
would want to be alone when she went amongst the
mountains; Fleuriss would be all right if she were
happy, perhaps, but a miserable companion would
be unendurable. Perhaps she had made a mistake
in taking Fleuriss away. Maybe it was true that
they had to go in different directions&mdash;that she
herself could not live at home, and that her little
sister could not live elsewhere. And even in Eepersip's
untamed heart there was a bit of pity. And
she found that that pity kept growing. How badly
the Eigleens must feel, after all! Once she smothered
it with the thought, "No, she will be happy
if she stays long enough, and they will forget her."
But it only began to grow again.
</p><p class="calibre13">Up to this unhappy time in Fleuriss's flowers had
not withered or drooped: in this they were like
those of Eepersip. But now Eepersip noticed that
for some peculiar reason hers only stayed fresh
and sweet. And then she thought again about the
mountains and about those poor wasted flowers,
and the pity grew and grew.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-138" data-page-number="123" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/131" data-page-index="131" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/131"></span></span>And one happy, happy day for Fleuriss, Eepersip
led her safely home again.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Good-bye, Fleuriss," she said. "I'm sorry you
wouldn't stay with me."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Yes, I know, Eepersip, but I just couldn't.
Why don't you come home&mdash;you've been away
so long?&mdash;and Mother cries for you still. Please
come."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, Fleuriss, I <i class="calibre10">couldn't</i>. If I were to go back
home now, I should just die&mdash;even with you."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Good-bye, then. Sometime I'm going to take
Mother to see that beautiful hill."
</p><p class="calibre13">"But not for a long time?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"As soon as I can."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Don't."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Why?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"You know. Please don't."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Well, I'm not sure. I'm going to&mdash;pretty
soon. Good-bye, Eepersip&mdash;Aren't you <i class="calibre10">ever</i>
coming home?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, Fleuriss, no!"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I wish you would."
</p><p class="calibre13">"But I can't."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Won't you let me take Mother and Daddy to
live over there?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Well, after a while&mdash;if you want to. I shan't
be there." <span><span id="calibre_link-139" data-page-number="124" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/132" data-page-index="132" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/132"></span></span>"Why, where are you going?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"I'm going to the beautiful, beautiful white
mountains. And then maybe the sea again, Fleuriss&mdash;the
sea."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oo!"
</p><p class="calibre13">"Coming?"
</p><p class="calibre13">"NO! I'll ask Mother to take me to the sea.
She will."
</p><p class="calibre13">"Then&mdash;good-bye!"
</p><p class="calibre13">And she decked Fleuriss's fern dress with beautiful
flowers&mdash;a crown of them and a girdle. A
sweet wind arose, carrying the scent of Eepersip's
flowers to Fleuriss. A few butterflies were blown
over to her. Eepersip stood on her tiptoes an instant:
then, quick as a flash, she whirled about and
bounded off, free&mdash;relieved of a gigantic burden.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">She went up to the lovely hill and stayed there
a few days, amid the dancing butterflies and the
gorgeous roses. At the lake she would dream hour
after hour and watch the little jewelled minnows
playing about the white stones and shining pebbles.
In the evening she crept into a great bed of
thick vines with flowers of white and gold, and
listened to the lapping of the waves and watched <span><span id="calibre_link-140" data-page-number="125" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/133" data-page-index="133" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/133"></span></span>the twinkling fireflies. They were her favourites,
those poor ignorant little insects. She loved them
as well as the delicate, gauzy butterflies, the sweeping
swallows with their slim white wings, or the
great gold-and-black bees. She adored them all,
but the tiny blue-black fireflies, with thin gauze
wings and the spot of phosphorescence showing
now and then, were perhaps the loveliest of all.
How she liked to see them playing about at dusk,
sparkling and gleaming&mdash;little stars of the trees,
in golden waves across the sky.
</p><p class="calibre13">Sometimes, when they began to come out, she
would go forth and dance and skip with myriads
of them clustered in her hair. Around each invisible
fern and blossom in her dress would gather
a row of the little insects, until finally one could
have seen her entire form bordered with fireflies.
And besides these which alighted on her dress,
thousands gathered swarming about her, so that
her head was entirely hidden in a maze of gold.
</p><p class="calibre13">Sometimes she would sleep at night and in the
daytime play with the butterflies, birds, and bees.
But now she began to sleep more and more in the
day and play about at night.
</p><p class="calibre13">One cool morning Eepersip went down the
lovely hill that she and Fleuriss had found. She
walked down and then out toward the pastured <span><span id="calibre_link-141" data-page-number="126" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/134" data-page-index="134" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/134"></span></span>side of the hill. Here she stayed for a long time.
She lived in the golden smell of steeple-bush, and
instead of the wild strawberries that she had had
on the hill she found great crops of blueberries.
And in this pasture she had a sample of a new food&mdash;checkerberries.
To be sure, she had eaten the
leaves often enough, but to see the waxen white
berries was quite new. These also she tasted and
found greatly to her liking. She would lie and eat
hundreds of those white berries which tasted of
the woods. They were almost as good as the blueberries.
</p><p class="calibre13">Now this pasture formed a steep hill, and one
delicious morning when a soft, warm wind was
blowing rather strongly, Eepersip climbed to the
top of it. And oh, what a sight met her dark brown
eyes! Far and near, far and near rose mountains,
mountains, mountains I Stretching away, fold after
fold, layer after layer, rose marvellous blue peaks,
with the dazzling light of the sun brightening the
white granite at some of their tops. Peak after
peak rose up around her, lake after lake stretched
out in the dim blue distance, with the sun striking
them until they were a mass of gold, like great
precious stones in that setting of purple mountains.
She could make out three or four farmhouses, but
no villages. She stood there entranced, watching.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-142" data-page-number="127" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/135" data-page-index="135" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/135"></span></span>
Then down she dashed, through the tall grass
sprinkled with buttercups and daisies. It seemed
miles. but it also seemed no more than seconds. At
last she found herself by the shore of a cobalt lake.
It was almost perfectly round, with a group of tiny
green islets sprinkled in it like a handful of emerald
beads. No house could Eepersip see, for the
lake was entirely surrounded with low green-blue
hills. The shore was for the most part soft white
sand, fine as pepper. With a cry of joy at the discovery
of this beautiful little lake Eepersip dashed
into it and swam in the cool of those waters from
the mountains. And then she saw, playing up and
down in the shallow water just off one of those
many beaches, a shoal of slim fishes. They were all
silver except one or two that were gold, and they
had rather bulging red eyes.
</p><p class="calibre13">For a long time Eepersip watched them. Then
something caused her to look up. This something
was the strange, shrill cry of a bird above her.
She looked up suddenly and saw the bird. But she
did not watch it, for the glint of something white&mdash;a
strange whiteness which she had never seen
before&mdash;caught her eye. She gazed long upon it,
until, when her eyes became accustomed, she was
able to make out the outline of a peak, going up
sharp as a tooth, with bumps of smoother outline <span><span id="calibre_link-143" data-page-number="128" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/136" data-page-index="136" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/136"></span></span>stretching away, away into the blue immensity of
space on either side.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh," said Eepersip, " a dream! Oh, what a
beautiful dream! But&mdash;I feel so wide awake."
</p><p class="calibre13">She gazed and gazed, silent.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh," she said again, after a while, "it cannot
be a dream, it mustn't be a dream!"
</p><p class="calibre13">She gazed and gazed again.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh," she repeated, "I must go there at once!
The snowy mountains!"
</p><p class="calibre13">She plunged into the beautiful, icy lake and
swam across it with never a thought of the beauty
in the green depths around her. Her eyes were
fixed upon that one thing only. Soon she reached
the opposite shore, consisting only of thick woods.
Her heart&mdash;that heart beautiful, yet with a certain
sense of childlikeness in it which had never
left her&mdash;was mad for a glimpse of those mountains.
It was then that she felt as if there were a
great bird in her, pulling her, hauling her forward,
regardless of the thorns and nettles which tore her
delicate dress of ferns and blossoms. At last she
got through the forest and found herself in an
open meadow, with the wondrous mountain before
her and warm rain falling gently. She saw a farmhouse,
and as she went along the simple peasant farmer
saw her and muttered to his wife: "Look <span><span id="calibre_link-144" data-page-number="129" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/137" data-page-index="137" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/137"></span></span>there. Mary." Mary looked, and then she said:
"Ay, God hath taken this child into his care&mdash;ignorance
demands mercy."
</p><p class="calibre13">A moment of intense thought. She gazed and
gazed, bewitched. Then she gave, or tried to give,
a little laugh. It did not sound. "Oh," she tried to
say, "how <i class="calibre10">queer</i> I feel! I believe I never felt so
queer." And indeed she did feel queer. For she felt
the feeling of speaking to her heart. She was talking,
it seemed to her, loudly, but when, even in the
midst of her talk, she listened, nothing sounded.
</p><p class="calibre13">After a few seconds, it seemed, she ran on, leaping
through the wet. Raindrops gathered on the
ferns and the flowers of her dress, outlining them
with the pearly water. She looked like a rain-fairy.
Hour after hour passed, and she went like the
wind itself; yet she did not tire. At last she found
herself near the foot of that wondrous mountain,
shimmering with snow-fields, cold white against a
deepening night sky.
</p><p class="calibre13">That night a bird of modest wood-colour, with
speckled breast, sang of moonlight; and, rippling
faintly, softly, came echoes from his silver-tongued
mate. They sang, and they answered, and the
moon-frost-tipped pines were quiet, and clouds
floated near, snowy palaces of silence. Spellbound,
Eepersip was borne away to fairy kingdoms where <span><span id="calibre_link-145" data-page-number="130" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/138" data-page-index="138" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/138"></span></span>she danced&nbsp;• and where birds sang the only
melody in the world.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">The next morning the sun came out and shone
through every raindrop in splendid crimsons and
purple-greens. Eepersip looked about her and discovered
a little plant with a peculiar flower of
white and crimson. She found that its leaves were
quite delicious, unlike anything that she had had
in the meadow or by the shore of the sea. They
were green&mdash;a strange pale green, delicately outlined
and veined in marble white and pale gold.
Eepersip loved their pleasant flavour, but could
not bear to touch them, they were so beautiful.
</p><p class="calibre13">Then she looked up and beheld the strange
rough outline of the mountain, and far in the distance,
almost on the top, was a great snow-field, on
which the sun shone directly, covering it incredibly
with brilliant tints and shades of gold. And, oh,
the bright green foliage, shining in the dear golden
light!
</p><p class="calibre13">"Fairyland!" whispered Eepersip. "I loved
the meadow, I loved the sea more, but even before
I am really <i class="calibre10">in</i> the mountains, I love them the best
of all." Then, after a pause, she added: "That <span><span id="calibre_link-146" data-page-number="131" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/139" data-page-index="139" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/139"></span></span>snow-field of gold, these heavenly little flowers&mdash;oh,
such beauty!"
</p><p class="calibre13">After a few more moments of breathless gazing,
gazing upon everything, she started up the
mountain. The first few hundred yards she followed
a faintly marked trail which led through
dense woods, over great boulders covered with
dark green moss. Occasionally a little rushing
brook trickled across her path. For quite a way
Eepersip kept climbing over the huge boulders,
and the path was very mossy. After a while it began
to grow fainter and harder to follow, and at
last it was shut off entirely by the thick bushes and
trees which surrounded it. Here she sat down to
rest and to think a while.
</p><p class="calibre13">She looked about and came upon a bubbling
spring, at which she drank. No water she had ever
found was like this. It tasted of the strong, delicious
mountain air. She drank deeply, and, when
she had quenched her thirst, continued her way.
Here flowers which made her think of foam at sea&mdash;white,
star-like, with silver-tipped petals&mdash;twined
themselves among the trees mingled with
wild roses&mdash;dawn-flowers of deep pink or sun-bright
yellow. Strange orchids grew about, many
of them pure white and fringed like fluffy clouds.
One had green blossoms with long whitish spurs&mdash; <span><span id="calibre_link-147" data-page-number="132" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/140" data-page-index="140" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/140"></span></span>mystic flowers on tall spikes with two smooth
leaves. Yellow lady-slippers made her think of
butterflies with folded wings, or of the sun peeping
out from dark clouds. But the loveliest of all were
pink orchids&mdash;hosts of them with more deeply
tinted lips fringed like fairies' fingers: hosts of
them on slender stems, each stem a dawn-sprite's
wand.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Like the dawn I saw once," she thought,
"when snow-pink fringey flowers wreathed the sky.
The sun was pleased and smiled. I danced for him,
and the bobolinks and skylarks greeted him with
song." There were tall flowers, too, pink silk beneath
white tissue, with very dark and curious
leaves up the stalks among the blossoms. Butterflies
were playing like sun rays, winging softly from
flower to flower. And as she went on she passed
through forests of thick bushes and poisonous
thorns, open pine-groves, and great pastures smelling
of hay-scented ferns and budding steeple-bush.
All the time the path, or rather the easiest way
through the thick bushes, had been fairly level, but
now it began to shoot up steeply, and it was all
Eepersip could do to keep herself from sliding
back in an avalanche of pebbles and stones. A bit
of tough scrambling followed, and at last she
broke out on a comparatively level piece of ground. <span><span id="calibre_link-148" data-page-number="133" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/141" data-page-index="141" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/141"></span></span>on one side of which was a deep ravine in which
she heard a brook rushing and rippling. On the
other side of the ravine was a peak of the mountain,
crowned with snow and with the sun flashing
upon it.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip longed to see the brook, which, by the
sound, she judged to be quite large. She was not
actually afraid to go down over those steep walls
of dirt and sand, but she <i class="calibre10">was</i> rather afraid that,
once being down, she would not be able to get up
again. So on she went, and it grew so steep that,
even by digging her feet into every crevice and
clutching the roots of the trees, which were getting
much scarcer and more stunted, she could just manage
to cling on.
</p><p class="calibre13">But at last a change came. She stood on that
high peak, on which there were only bare rocks
and a little snow, no roots or plants. On either side
it went down, down, and it was getting late in the
afternoon. She could see nothing to do. Still the
highest peak was many miles ahead, and she knew
that she could not make it in the remaining daylight.
So she climbed warily down into a little
crevice, where a few ferns and luscious mountain
blueberries managed to grow. She ate a supper of
these and of another hardy little berry which she
found; then slept in peace till daybreak, her tired <span><span id="calibre_link-149" data-page-number="134" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/142" data-page-index="142" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/142"></span></span>mind dreaming of strange things&mdash;of deep palaces
at the bottom of the sea and snow palaces at
the tops of the mountains; of fairies, nymphs, and
elves. 
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">In the morning she breakfasted on the mountain
blueberries again, and found, much to her delight,
that they quenched her thirst almost as well
as water. After her juicy breakfast she went on
down for about a mile; then up, up again on sheer
walls of rock, where there was not a sign of a plant
of any kind. After a stretch of difficult climbing
snow again began to appear, as the slope became
more level. Eepersip went down through a snug
hollow in the rocks, where it was thick with small,
scrubby trees and where very little snow had managed
to penetrate the thick branches.
</p><p class="calibre13">Oh, but it was cold up here on these tremendous
heights; the wind was keen and shrilly whistling.
But, however cold, it was a mountain wind, an exhilarating
mountain wind which made Eepersip
leap into the air&mdash;leap and dance as on the
meadow. Then, after she had rested a while under
the welcome branches of the stunted firs and eaten
tart mountain blueberries again, she went on, up <span><span id="calibre_link-150" data-page-number="135" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/143" data-page-index="143" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/143"></span></span>out of the hollow and on to the solid rock covered
a deep snow, into which she sank at every step.
Mother mile she trudged. along, pulling herself
through it. And still the mighty peak retreated before
her, so that she could make no progress&mdash;or,
at least, it seemed so. It seemed as far away and as
faint in the snowy distance as from where she had
been when the night had come on&mdash;a dreaming
peak caressed with fingers of mist.
</p><p class="calibre13">At last the ground went up abruptly again.
However steep, Eepersip found it much easier, being
there wasn't so much snow. It rose and rose,
becoming more gradual, until she stood on another
high peak, looking off over a tremendous range of
mountains. Large flakes of snow were falling
gently, so that she could not see much of these.
She thought that she was now on the highest peak,
and she sat down to wait for the snow to cease and
give her a clear view. After a time it did; and then,
and not until then, she saw another peak, the true
summit of the mountain, going up, up, and up on
the other side of a deep valley into which she
would have to descend. After sucking a few handfuls
of the pure mountain snow, she set off with a 
light heart and a happy spirit, her feet falling fast
through the light drifts. After a while she got
down into the valley; and here she came upon a <span><span id="calibre_link-151" data-page-number="136" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/144" data-page-index="144" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/144"></span></span>brooklet full of icicles, winding through the long
ravine and dashing over the green slimy rocks in
great cascades of rattling icicles and foam. Eepersip
drank deeply, and was refreshed.
</p><p class="calibre13">Then, after resting a few moments, she went on,
up that steep wall of snow and rock which would
take her to the longed-for summit. Eepersip
counted sixteen brooklets rushing down over it,
tarrying hundreds of icicles with their currents,
foaming and dashing with spray and myriads of
shiny iridescent bubbles.
</p><p class="calibre13">Across brook after brook she went, watching
the colours change in the dazzling snowflakes. The
sun was shining brilliantly now, making everything
unimaginably beautiful in magnificent shades of
ruby, copper, silver-gold, emerald, and sapphire.
Each snowflake seemed covered with an almost
invisible layer of they sparkling gems. And once,
when Eepersip sat down in a deep snow-bank to
watch and to rest, the sun happened to strike directly
on one of the many brooklets that went
dashing down the mountain-side, making it a blinding
ribbon of silver and gold. Occasionally Eepersip
saw the blossoms of the beautiful talatuna, with
ruby-red leaves and blossoms of pale green and
changing white. She thought that the leaves were
<i class="calibre10">all</i> red, but when the wind flipped one over she saw <span><span id="calibre_link-152" data-page-number="137" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/145" data-page-index="145" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/145"></span></span>that their backs were moon-white, pale but glistening.
</p><p class="calibre13">On she went, through the incredible beauty of
the fairyland about her. "Oh," she murmured to
herself, "how marvellous it is! Oh, fairies,
fairies." She whirled happily around. She had felt
a few delicate touches on her shoulders, and at
once the air was a-flock with glistening snowflakes.
Each fern in her dress was bordered with a row of
the fairy things, and her autumn hair was crowned
white.
</p><p class="calibre13">After a while a slight breeze sprang up and the
big flakes whirled faster. The breeze rose and rose
until it was a strong, cold wind, and she could not
see a foot before her. The only thing to do was to
wait for clear weather. But in that she was disappointed,
for it was growing darker and darker,
and at last she realized that night was coming on.
So she lay down and ate a supper of snow, as it fell
and fell.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">All night the snow whirled and whirled, and in
the morning Eepersip was completely buried. It
was a long, hard task to find her way out, or rather
to push her way out, for almost as fast as the snow <span><span id="calibre_link-153" data-page-number="138" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/146" data-page-index="146" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/146"></span></span>fell it froze into ice, so that there was on top of
Eepersip a thick layer of ice. But just before she
decided to give up and wait for warmer weather,
she broke through. Out into the bright sunlight she
came; and lo and behold! all the ferns on her dress,
and the dainty blossoms, together with her hair,
were covered with a layer of ice which shimmered
and sparkled in the sun like jewels set in something
brighter than the brightest gold.
</p><p class="calibre13">But as soon as she came out into the sun the ice
began to melt and run off in all directions, and as
she skipped and jumped about she was almost
hidden in the shower of water-drops which flew
from her as she ran.
</p><p class="calibre13">And how beautiful, how fairy-like, she was!
Each fern was covered with a thin layer of the
melting it c, and the crown of pink blossoms around
her curly hair was frozen likewise, their fair colour
persisting through the ice. Once in a while, when
the sun touched her, she was a blaze of colour&mdash;of
silver and gold, with here and there a splotch of
brilliant red as the sun struck a red flower.
</p><p class="calibre13">After she had found that there was nothing to
be eaten except snow, she sucked a few handfuls,
flavoured with the petals of the flowers which she
wore. Then she went on, through paradises of silver,
gold, and red, through deep hollows of  <span><span id="calibre_link-154" data-page-number="139" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/147" data-page-index="147" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/147"></span></span>shining green. Everything was something besides
white, and the world that was in Eepersip's range
of vision was fairyland.
</p><p class="calibre13">But, as she went on, clouds began to float in&mdash;little
white clouds. They grew thicker and thicker,
until, before she had come near the highest peak,
there was nothing but pearly mist&mdash;scudding
grey mist, curling into fantastic shapes as it rose.
She could sec nothing, and she sat down in the
snow to wait. That night a gale came up, whistling
and howling around the peaks, reminding Eepersip
of that storm at sea. What an awesome sound
it made! It sleeted, too, and when she awoke the
next morning the snow was covered with a crust.
The mist had partly cleared, and she pushed on
again. She went through icy hollows and up on
shimmering peaks, until, finally, she saw near her
that long-sought summit, and, with a shout of joy,
she dashed up. Fast she went, but when she really
reached it at last, the mist had closed in again, the
wind was up, and it was sleeting furiously. It was
only through a break in the mist that she had made
the summit at all.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">The next morning it was still misty, but not
nearly so thick. There was even a faint purple glow <span><span id="calibre_link-155" data-page-number="140" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/148" data-page-index="148" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/148"></span></span>over on the eastern horizon where the sun was
rising. Occasionally the mist would break open
above, and she would see glimpses of blue sky&mdash;the
deep, deep blue of that day in the meadow
with Fleuriss. And lying all around on the boulders
were frost-feathers. When Eepersip first saw them
she thought that she was dreaming. But no, they
were really there, delicate ferns and feathers with
scalloped edges&mdash;ferns and feathers of frost.
</p><p class="calibre13">"Oh, mountain-fairies&mdash;fairies have left them
here," she said quietly. Some were as long as her
forearm, and others tiny&mdash;oh, so tiny; some were
almost round like the inner feathers of a bird, and
others long and narrow like the outer plumes.
Down in a hollow were some stunted firs, laden
with snow and covered with those fronds of ivory
chiselled by wind-sprites, lovelier than anything
Eepersip had ever seen, lovelier than anything
ever made by Nature. No, Nature could never
have carved them, Eepersip thought. The fairies&mdash;fairies!
</p><p class="calibre13">Once she found a hollowed rock entirely lined
with them, like a fairy's crystal palace with strange
shadowy recesses. They crowded everywhere they
could find room, and sometimes, when there was
no other place, rippled on the snow. They overlapped
on the rocks, and hung from windward <span><span id="calibre_link-156" data-page-number="141" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/149" data-page-index="149" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/149"></span></span>crags, pointing into the w ind. And behold! Eepersip's
dress and her head were covered with small
ones, like a diadem&mdash;a fairy crown and fairy
ornaments. Moving gently, so as not to disturb
them from where they rested, she wandered from
one cluster to another, looking carefully at each
one, noting each special pattern, each magic tracery.
All day she followed the winding rabbit-trails
amid the feathery firs.
</p><p class="calibre13">The sun, too, had been pushing out. Now the
mist opened in one direction, and Eepersip caught
a fleeting glimpse of snowy peaks;
but it closed again. It opened a trifle longer in another direction,
and Eepersip saw, 'way down below, first low
blue-green foothills and lakes golden with the sun,
then higher purple hills, melting into range after
range of billowing mountains, and valley after valley
filled with white clouds rapidly lifting. The
mist shut in. Another direction opened in the same
way, with hills fading into mountains; and far off
on the horizon was another range of snow mountains,
lying just under great white clouds. There
were clouds hanging over the valleys too, and they
cast strange shadows on the sunlit trees far below.
When the mist shut in, the golden lakes seemed to
stay the longest. and after the mountains had entirely
disappeared they could he seen as if hanging <span><span id="calibre_link-157" data-page-number="142" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/150" data-page-index="150" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/150"></span></span>in mid-air, limpid pools of gold. And more sides
opened, and more, the waits growing shorter in
between, until, on a gust of mountain wind, the
last of the mist went scudding away, banished, and
the sun broke out into the blue sky. The snow
sparkled, the mountains sparkled, the lakes and
rivers sparkled, the frost-feathers sparkled, the
air itself sparkled. And the mountains of the range
that Eepersip was in, crowned with snow, gleamed
like gold. Down on one side of the snowy peak
dashed a great river, green and swirling, covered
with clots of foam. Sometimes it would cascade
over the rocks throwing up a fountain of spray,
and sometimes it would slip over a smooth slide,
then, whirling round and round in a rock basin,
thunder down another great cliff in a shower of
bubbles, rattling icicles, and foam. It not its way
through a green hollow in the snow, and where it
tunnelled under the snow-hanks it was overhung
with long, gleaming icicles.
</p><p class="calibre13">Eepersip danced in the snow, among the frost-feathers,
all that day&mdash;danced like a mountain
sprite, leaping high, then running gracefully in a
shower of water-drops which flew from her as the
frost-feathers melted in the warmth of the sunlight.
She danced down to the river and played
there a while&mdash;played with the white foam.
</p>
<div class="calibre3"></div>
<p class="calibre13"> <span><span id="calibre_link-158" data-page-number="143" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/151" data-page-index="151" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/151"></span></span>At sunset she was again at the peak of her mountain
The sky flushed with magic; a great cloud
in the west becamea brilliantly fringed with gold
and red-gold, the east was all submerged in a lilac
sea, and a delicate laciness of pink trailed across
the zenith. Sunset fairies alighted on the snow-peaks
they were fiery for a moment, and all the
great snow-fields were flaming. Then the colour
faded to pink on the summits. But in the sky Nature
still flung about her colours wildly&mdash;fire was
in the zenith, the long bank of clouds was vividly
fringed with red-gold, and there to the south it
changed to caverns of shadowed pink and strange
violet. Seas and bays and cloud islands formed out
of it&mdash;seas of a strange greenish rose. Then one
thrill and flame of gold spread about the whole
earth; the snow at her feet was shadowy gold, and
a pathway of it danced upon the air 'way to the
horizon. It played upon each frost-feather; the
eastern mountains were flushed with this soft gold.
</p><p class="calibre13">And then, dizzy with the colour and the beauty,
Eepersip fell asleep, her fingers clutching the rosy
snow. 
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">The next morning the frost-feathers had almost
disappeared underneath a new snowfall. The air <span><span id="calibre_link-159" data-page-number="144" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/152" data-page-index="152" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/152"></span></span>was full of its fresh scent, as it came down gently
in tremendous flakes. Here and there Eepersip saw
one of the lovely blossoms of the talatuna, with
those same ruby-red leaves. How beautiful they
were, growing in great clusters, just peeping
through the snow! Once in a while a pale cream-coloured
mountain moth would flit before her.
Occasional gusts brought swarms of tiny bottle-green,
white-winged snow-beetles, and the air was
a-buzz with them. Sometimes a blue or white insect
like a firefly would hover past, a strange red
light gleaming about its transparent body.
</p><p class="calibre13">On and on Eepersip explored, seeing nothing
but the wonderland about her&mdash;the fairy palaces
of snow, the fluttering, hovering insects, and the
beautiful mountain flowers. Following the icy river
down, she came sometimes to a great cascade of
the green water&mdash;a cascade coming over one of
those great cliffs, washing down the snow, throwing
up fountains and clouds of spray in its furious
descent. Sometimes it cut under the banks, making
a green cave hung with icicles gleaming strangely.
One of these had been made when the river was in
flood; now it was large enough for Eepersip to
stand in, and, wading in water about up to her
knees, she went back into its innermost recesses,
where the roar of the stream was muffled. There <span><span id="calibre_link-160" data-page-number="145" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/153" data-page-index="153" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/153"></span></span>were fish there&mdash;trout playing in the whirlpools
and riding swiftly with the current. She found
some odd bright stones and gleaming pebbles in
this mysterious place, silent save for the deadened
rush of water.
</p><p class="calibre13">Sometimes, again, the rushing brook took such
steep course that Eepersip was forced to make a
detour into the woods for a little way, through
clumps of the firs, now growing less stunted, but
hung with icicles which clicked together in the
wind, sounding to Eepersip like fairy castanets.
Even at this high altitude, she saw occasionally a
white pine, each cluster of pale green needles laden
with snow&mdash;tufts of snow which seemed to make
little faces peering out from the tree. Bursts of
happiness would overwhelm her now and then, and
she would leap high and dart like some frightened
deer or mountain nymph.
</p><p class="calibre13">Once she found beautiful little violet-shaped
pink flowers with bowed heads and feathery leaves&mdash;snow-pinks
blooming there, thrusting their buds
from the snow itself. She tucked a spray of them
into her dress of fluttering ferns.
</p><p class="calibre13">And then she would return to the river and follow
it again. When the moon came, dappling the
foamy water with silver, she watched it as it
dipped down its forehead in the stream and <span><span id="calibre_link-161" data-page-number="146" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/154" data-page-index="154" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/154"></span></span>touched the treetops with magic. Then she would
go on again through the moonlit night. Once she
came to a place where the brook separated, and
she had a difficulty choosing which branch to
follow.
</p><p class="calibre13">And when the russet dawn reappeared, tipping
tie mountains with apple-blossom and fire, she had
followed it to its goal in the very meadow from
where she had started&mdash;a pool hitherto unseen
by her. About a hundred feet across it was, beached
with clean white pebbles. In it bloomed water-lilies,
fragrant and white, with centres of gold;
strange red flowers, too, she saw on the bottom,
growing between the pebbles. Dragonflies with
crackling wings swept over it in circles. She saw,
too, a shoal of tiny fishes of a brownish colour,
striped with yellow. They would suddenly dart
forward as if something had frightened them, and
then poise themselves stock-still, mimicking so
many sticks in the shadows of the abundant lily-pads.
</p><p class="calibre13">She was wading about in the pool when suddenly&mdash;where
there had been ground for her foot to
rest on, nothing was there. The bottom of the pool
under her foot had slid forward and collapsed!
Suddenly "Clug-glug, clug-glug, chugarum, glug!"
reached her, as a big bull-frog's nose appeared by <span><span id="calibre_link-162" data-page-number="147" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/155" data-page-index="155" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/155"></span></span>the side of a lily-pad. A second later the frog
diked up on the lily-pad and stared at Eepersip
with his goggly eves. She burst out laughing, he
looked so ridiculous staring at her like that.
</p><p class="calibre13">She stayed in the meadow, playing gaily among
tie leaves and flowers. Butterflies of all the
colours of the rainbow swept over it in great flocks.
Flowers bloomed so thickly that there was hardly
any grass&mdash;white ones with waxen petals. striped
and bordered with heavy golden bands; red ones
with centres of dark green-gold; great blossoms of
pink and purple, whose petals fluttered about in
the breeze like butterflies. 
</p><p class="calibre13">One morning she was awakened early by "Peep,
peep, twitter-itter-ee-e-e-e-e-e, twit chirup, twitter-ee-e-e,
twit!" She looked up and saw a great flock
of snow-white birds with long narrow wings. They
were flying northward. The flock was much more
gigantic than Eepersip had supposed, for it kept
on until she began to think that it was going round
and round. But no: after ten or fifteen minutes the
sky cleared, and she heard faintly in the distance:
"Twitter-itter-ee-e-e-e-e, <i class="calibre10">ee-e-per-s-sip!</i> e-e-p, e-ep,
chirup."
</p><p class="calibre13">Day after day she danced here, playing, as on
the first meadow, the butterflies, flowers, and
swallows. And now, as she danced, she seemed to <span><span id="calibre_link-163" data-page-number="148" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/156" data-page-index="156" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/156"></span></span>float through the air, her feet almost motionless.
Sometimes she would leap high and come down&mdash;<i class="calibre10">float</i>
down&mdash;quite slowly. She seemed to have no
weight at all, and a breeze would almost lift her
off the ground and hold her up in the air. Indeed,
when she ran with the wind behind her she would
be <i class="calibre10">blown</i> along&mdash;blown like a leaf just above the
flowers.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">One day she was dancing there&mdash;dancing and
leaping in the long grass, amid the blossoms. Butterflies
drifted over the sunny field&mdash;butterflies
of red and yellow, blue and green, black and white,
orange and purple. How gracefully they flew; how
delicately they alighted on the flowers; how fairy-like
they were, hovering for an instant over some
blossom, then dipping their wings and starting off
again! Eepersip felt as though&mdash;as though she
were going to be one of them; as though she were
so happy that she must fly about with them, sip the
honey from the flowers with them.
</p><p class="calibre13">As she was thinking happily she heard a few
faint peeps, which became louder as she danced
toward a certain part of the field. Then there was a
desperate twitter right at her feet, and, looking <span><span id="calibre_link-164" data-page-number="149" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/157" data-page-index="157" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/157"></span></span>down she saw a yellow fledgling hopping towards
her. She picked him up carefully and saw that he
had broken his left wing. She worked a moment
with her hands and pulled the bone into place.
Then she made him a comfortable nest of grass
and net out to see where he had come from. Looking
up, she saw a nest from which a bird was peering
about anxiously. Straightway she took the little
one from the nest <i class="calibre10">she</i> had made, and climbed the
tree with it to its own nest; upon which the mother-bird
gave a twitter of joy.
</p><p class="calibre13">After doing this Eepersip descended the tree
and continued her happy dance with the butterflies
until evening. Then they all found shelters under
the leaves, and the stars came out, one by one.
Presently Eepersip spied a flicker in the meadow&mdash;then
another and still another, until the fireflies
were out in full play. They gathered around Eepersip
in one flaming mass, kissing her with their
feathery wings. Making her way over to the pool,
she saw her reflection, a shimmer of gold.
</p><p class="calibre13">A light darted out toward her from the woods;
then another and yet another, until there were
hundreds of lights flickering and blinking at her
from all corners of the great field&mdash;the lights of
elves and gnomes, little fairies of the field. And
she danced happily among them&mdash;danced until <span><span id="calibre_link-165" data-page-number="150" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/158" data-page-index="158" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/158"></span></span>the dawn appeared on the horizon, sending away
the darkness and making the stars fade into space.
It flushed the whole sky with rose, sent arms of it
even as far as the west; arms and streamers of
colour which paled toward their tips. Little white
clouds grew pink, too, and the colour was reflected
on the distant mountain-tops. Again the snow-field
seemed to become fire&mdash;fire which was soon
quenched by the coolness of the snow. As the sun
sent its first golden beams above the horizon, the
colour faded, turned to yellow, and soon entirely
disappeared. Then the sky was blue&mdash;deep, quivering
blue, with the fluffy clouds like pearls in an
azure setting.
</p><p class="calibre13">Suddenly Eepersip saw that she was dressed in a
flouncy array of spring crocuses and maidenhair
ferns. Lovely flowers of pink and yellow were entwined
in her hair, and butterflies fluttered around
her. She danced happily and leaped high in the air.
How free and light she felt in the lovely dress that
had been given her!
</p><p class="calibre13">That day Eepersip was even happier than usual.
She floated about, visiting each flower, each bush
and tree. She played games with the butterflies, the
games she had played on the old meadow, that first
summer of her life in the House without Windows.
When she rested, she sat on top of a laurel-bush, <span><span id="calibre_link-166" data-page-number="151" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/159" data-page-index="159" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/159"></span></span>and not a twig bent beneath her. The slightest
breeze blew her about, changed the direction of
her dance. Butterfly after butterfly flew to her,
flock after flock, as if they had some message to
tell her; and after each visit she was happier than
before. Yes, they were messengers, these happy
creatures; messengers who came to whisper her a
secret&mdash;a secret from Nature, a secret of the
beautiful meadow, a secret from the fairies.
</p><p class="calibre13">And, when the sun again tinged the sky with
colour, a flock of these butterflies, of purple and
gold and green, came swooping and alighted on
her head in a circle, the largest in front. Others
came in myriads and covered her dress with delicate
wing-touches. Eepersip held out her arms a
moment. A gold-and-black one alighted on each
wrist. And then&mdash;she rose into the air, and, hovering
an instant over a great laurel-bush, vanished.
</p><p class="calibre13">She was a fairy&mdash;a wood-nymph. She would be
invisible for ever to all mortals, save those few
who have minds to believe, eyes to see. To these
she is ever present, the spirit of Nature&mdash;a sprite
of the meadow, a naiad of lakes, a nymph of the
woods.

<p class="calibre9">HISTORICAL NOTE
</p><p class="calibre9">(By Another Hand)
</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre13">IN the opening week of January, 1923, there
appeared on the outside of a certain door within
a dingy, sunless, and cramped apartment a slip of
paper bearing the following typewritten notice:
</p><p class="calibre13">Nobody may come into this room
if the door is shut tight (if
it is shut not quite latched it
is all right) without knocking.
The person in the room if he
agrees that one shall come in
will say "come in," or something
like that and if he does
not agree to it he will say "Not
yet, please," or something like
that. The door may be shut if
nobody is in the room but if a
person wants to come in, knocks
and hears no answer that means
that there is no one in the room
and he must not go in.
</p><p class="calibre13">Reason. If the door is shut
tight and a person is in the
room the shut door means that
the person in the room wishes to
be left alone. <span><span id="calibre_link-168" data-page-number="153" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/161" data-page-index="161" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/161"></span></span>The author of this odd manifesto (here reproduced
with strict textual exactitude from the
frayed original) was the author of the foregoing
story, then just three months short of nine years
old. The door on which it appeared was that of the
room in which, on a small typewriter, she wrote
down the adventures of Eepersip; and the week in
which it appeared was that in which these adventures
had their beginning.
</p><p class="calibre13">She finished them, in the same room, three
months later, early in the March of her ninth completed
year and a few days after her birthday.
One of her curious, slightly un-American inventions,
I must here explain, was the concept of her
own birthday as an annual occasion for handing
out things to the other members of her family. She
planned this story from the beginning as a gift for
her mother on March 4. Would her mother
"like" it, though? On that point there would have
to be a disinterested opinion&mdash;as it happened,
mine. With intense secrecy, behind the latched
door of that room guarded by the constrained preparatory
notice, she read me the instalments as
they were produced.
</p><p class="calibre13">My candid guess was that her mother would indeed
"like" it. I liked it myself, if only as unconscious
expression of a radiant physical vitality&mdash; <span><span id="calibre_link-169" data-page-number="154" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/162" data-page-index="162" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/162"></span></span>so much I found in it of the mighty swimmer, the
enjoyable young comrade of trail and river, always
ready to swing a paddle tirelessly or carry ungrumbling
a full fair share of pack. I liked it, too,
as her answer to the one year which she had ever
been called upon to spend in undeniably tawdry surroundings.
</p>
But, alas, there came interruptions<div class="calibre33"></div>one of
<p class="calibre13">them in the shape of the only appreciable illness
she has ever had&mdash;and these pulled down her
average daily output. On her big days the small
typist clicked off fresh copy to the extent of from
four to five thousand words; but still the appointed
morning caught her some pages short of
the end. The tale came to Finis a few days later.
Its length, in that first incarnation, was some
40,000 words, or not far from what it is now. 
</p><p class="calibre13">Up to that point there had been, of course, no
thought of print. It was I who introduced the question
of print; and it had at that time no connection
whatever with publication. The author of the story
never had (and never has) experienced any school
system, public or private, her education having
been exclusively the home-made one devised by her
mother; and I was beginning to think it high time
that print became a part of it. It was in fine, my
idea that we ought to have a piece of her work put <span><span id="calibre_link-170" data-page-number="155" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/163" data-page-index="163" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/163"></span></span>into type in some small shop where she could set
part of it herself, pull her own proofs, learn more
about proof-reading by correcting them, and see
the whole thing through to the binding of a small
armful of copies for her friends.
</p><p class="calibre13">But before anything of that sort was done I
wanted her to have the practice of revising her first
copy as carefully as possible and putting it into
strictly printable condition&mdash;as, indeed, she was
eager to do. Accordingly she took it away with her
in the summer, worked on it from early July
through September in the intervals of swimming,
canoeing, mountain-climbing, and plain day-dreaming,
and brought it back, on the 5th of October,
1923, ready for print. Twenty-four hours later we
left it in a burning building from which nothing got
out but the lucky human occupants. 
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">From the point of view of an admittedly fond
parent&mdash;for I can make no slightest pretension
to the ability to contemplate all this with a stranger's
or a critic's detachment&mdash;it was heart-rending
to watch the nine-year-old author torture her
memory to the end of reconstituting the tale in its
first shape. There were, during the next weeks, a <span><span id="calibre_link-171" data-page-number="156" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/164" data-page-index="164" data-page-quality="1" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/164"></span></span>good many blank hours at the typewriter, and it
was slowly and painfully that page followed page.
At this rate, it was going to take about three years
merely to salvage what had once been manufactured
out of the void in three months.
</p><p class="calibre13">Then, one day in December, everything was
suddenly different. As an experiment of despair,
Barbara had stopped trying to remember the
shape of sentences, the precise order and phraseology
of details, and had begun to let the material
come back as it listed. And to her astonishment
it came in a freshet, like northern rivers when the
ice goes out. When, a few days later, we put work
aside to organize our makeshift Christmas, she
was still in a happy glow, the first third of the
fantasy existed again, and the story was running
over its banks.
</p><p class="calibre13">There followed one interruption after another,
and it was not until the autumn of 1924 that the
second draft was completed. In the late winter of
1924-25, Barbara worked patiently through the
first third, putting it in what she hoped would be
final shape. The manuscript had to be laid away in
May of 1925, and was not touched again for nine
months. Then, in February and March, 1926, she
did her revision of the second and third parts,
made a few minor improvements in Part I, and <span><span id="calibre_link-172" data-page-number="157" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/165" data-page-index="165" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/165"></span></span>typed out a fair copy of the whole&mdash;the copy
from which this little book is set.
</p><p class="calibre13">To what extent is this twelve-year-old manuscript
identical with the nine-year-old story? To a
far greater extent, I am sure, than seems compatible
with the huge number of hours spent on it since
it was completed&nbsp;; for it happens that a disproportionate
number of those hours has gone into laborious,
at times unconscious, recovery of the precise
effects which were in the lost original. The differences
are not where a stranger to the author would
naturally look for them: that is, in the diction and
the build of sentences. Barbara's vocabulary at
nine was, of course, a stratified arrangement of
deposits from Walter de la Mare<sup id="calibre_link-9" class="reference"><a href="#calibre_link-8" type="noteref">[1]</a></sup> and George
Macdonald,<sup id="calibre_link-10" class="reference"><a href="#calibre_link-8" type="noteref">[1]</a></sup> W. H. Hudson<sup id="calibre_link-11" class="reference"><a href="#calibre_link-8" type="noteref">[1]</a></sup> and Mark Twain,
Shelley and Scott; that is to say, it was just what
it is now except for the later addition of words
which could not be in this story anyhow&mdash;the
words of history, of science. And certainly the
fundamental ideas and emotions of the story have
undergone no change. The fact is, it was conceived
and written at the end of a phase which could not
return&mdash;that phase of normal childhood in which <span><span id="calibre_link-173" data-page-number="158" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/166" data-page-index="166" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/166"></span></span>nature means nearly everything and civilization
nearly nothing. The whole purport of Eepersip's
existence is simply a healthy nine-year-old consciousness
made articulate&mdash;something that an
eleven-year-old could recover only by a feat of
the memory, and an adult mind only by an improbable
<i class="calibre10">tour de force</i> of the imagination. Barbara,
in short, designed this curious narrative at
the last moment when to do so would have been at
all open to her. By no human possibility could it
have been in her head at eleven if she had not had
it down on paper at nine.
</p><p class="calibre13">The chief differences, then, between the printed
and the destroyed versions represent the inevitable
development of the author's taste in minor particulars,
and they are these: (1) There is appreciably
less of the pursuit-and-escape device, and
correspondingly more of the sheer revelling in
natural beauty; (2) a great many exact measurements,
in the form of dates, distances, rates,
heights, and depths, have been omitted as realistic
and therefore trivializing; (3) there is a somewhat
maturer attempt to keep the fauna and flora
consistent with latitude, altitude, and season; and
(4) the lapse of time is managed rather more consciously
and coherently than it was in the first
place. If, in the treatment of these and other  <span><span id="calibre_link-174" data-page-number="160" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/168" data-page-index="168" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/168"></span></span>details of the story, there seems to he a progressive
increase in maturity, that is a consequence and a
measure of the nine months' interval between the
author's revision of Part I and her revision of
Parts II and III.
</p><p class="calibre13">It will be observed that the differences involve
little or no addition. The one piece of addition is
in the episode of Eepersip's young sister Fleuriss,
which is considerably more developed. The obvious
reason for this is that the author's own young
sister, at the time of the first draft, existed only
as an insistent demand on Barbara's part; whereas
in the period of the revision she was a dream fulfilled,
subject to adoring daily observation.
</p><p class="calibre13">As to ordinary literacy, there is no perceptible
difference, and has been none since the typewritten
by-products of Barbara's sixth and seventh years.
In short, what the leader is here given is an articulate
eight&mdash;and nine-year-old child's outpouring of
her own dreams and longings in a fanciful tale,
superficially revised by the hand of a twelve-year-old
girl whose life on its more artificial side is
made up principally of books and music.
</p><p class="calibre13"><span class="tiinherit">*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*<span class="wst-gap">⁠</span>*</span>
</p><p class="calibre13">It was the youthful author's idea, not mine, that
her story should be accompanied by a ward of  <span><span id="calibre_link-175" data-page-number="161" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/169" data-page-index="169" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/169"></span></span>explanation from her father. I do not know how,
when, or exactly why she formulated such a requirement,
any more than I can explain where she
got many mother of the ideas with which she has
been known to startle or confound me. Long after
the story had been completed and while it was
undergoing revision, there arrived a day on which
I was told that the requirement existed: that Barbara
had secretly been counting on me, and with
pleasure in the thought. Pleasure! If I could give
that and so easily, and to her, it not mine to
make a gesture of resistance. I insist only that
what I have to say shall be placed where it can
stand between no reader and the story.
</p><p class="calibre13">It would be neither good manners nor good
sense for me to attempt any sort of appraisal of
this chronicle of Eepersip's adventures in the spacious
rooms of her House without Windows. I
have been too near to the whole thing, and am too
near the chronicler. The most that I can now add
without impropriety is a statement of why the first
thought, a book to be manufactured but by no
means published, gave way after all to a different
idea.
</p><p class="calibre13">It began to strike me that here was something
representatively valuable&mdash;valuable, I mean, as
a representation of something lovely in  <span><span id="calibre_link-176" data-page-number="162" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/170" data-page-index="170" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/170"></span></span>generalized childhood itself&mdash;and yet not so yens likely
to achieve frequent expression. The fact is that the
impulses crystallized in this story mostly fade into
the light of common day a year or two before the
dawn of that amount of mechanical articulacy
which is necessary for a tangible expression of
them; end they are therefore almost never expressed.
Actually, do not happen to be acquainted
with a single prose document of much scope which
achieves the full expression, or any first-hand expression,
of what in a normal, healthy child's
mind and heart during that mysterious phase when
butterflies, flowers, winging swallow, and white-tapped
waves are twice as real as even a quite bearable
parent, and incomparably more important&mdash;the
phase before there Is any unshakable Tyranny
of Things.
</p><p class="calibre13">What is probably unusual about Barbara is the
conspiracy of the circumstances which have made
these two things, the phase and the necessary articulacy,
overlap. She is precocious, and the
phase may have lasted a year or two longer than it
does in many. She is not excessively gregarious and
has not been regimented in schools and groups;
therefore nothing has as yet standardized her, or
ironed out her spontaneity, or made her particularly
ashamed of it She has been given plenty of <span><span id="calibre_link-177" data-page-number="163" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/171" data-page-index="171" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/171"></span></span>time to know herself. And, almost above all,
having used a typewriter as a plaything from a
time that she can't remember, she was able to
rattle off an easy 1200 words an hour, with any
awareness of the physical process, years before
penmanship could have developed half the proficiency,
even with intense concentration on the
physical process alone.
</p><p class="calibre13">I formed, then, the opinion that her Eepersip,
who fives an ardent life of three or four years in
nearly every child's consciousness, lives not at all
anywhere no the world's multitude of books. And
it came to seem to me that this Eepersip very possibly
has something to say to you about your children,
and about yourself of a time that you may
easily have forgotten, as well as, perhaps, to your
children directly.
</p><p class="calibre13">A last point: Barbara has been given by her
parents, in the final preparation of this manuscript,
exactly what help she has asked for. That is not
nearly so much help as many an adult author often
has from us, for there is not one idea or structural
change of ours in the entire story. But I see no
value in withholding solicited advice in order to
make a Roman holiday for those who like to
chuckle or guffaw over infantile slips in spelling
and grammar. Barbara, whose spelling and  <span><span id="calibre_link-178" data-page-number="164" data-page-name="Page:The House Without Windows.djvu/172" data-page-index="172" data-page-quality="3" title="Page:The_House_Without_Windows.djvu/172"></span></span>grammarhappen to be very reliable, would want us to
straighten them out for her if they weren't; and
we should do it. When she asks whether a comma
will do or ought it to be a semi-colon? we answer
as well as we can. When she wants to know:
"have I made it clear what this means?" or
"Have I used this word twice too near together?"
of course we say how it strikes us. Annoyingly
from my Yankee point of view, she insists
on a preference for Oxford spelling, undoubtedly
met in three out of four of the contemporary books
which she reads. Well, then, I point out to her that
if going to spell "colour" she, must also
spell "favourite" and "storey" and "veranda."
But the words themselves, the sentences, are hers,
just as truly as is the pattern of the whole; and
hers is a really workmanlike care for weeding out
gawky constructions and repetitions of the words
of which she ins been successively over-fond.
</p><p class="calibre13">One the great objects of imaginative writing,
I take it, is to have joy. Another, not wholly separable
from the first, is to learn you go. I like to
suppose that Barbara, turned twelve, is having
her just share of both.
